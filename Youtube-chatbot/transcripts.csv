"Dual-Brain Psychology"" by Frederich Schiffer",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUuypSm22Gc,"So this is a novel theory of um cerebral laterality and psychopathology and uh and and and I I think it has relevance to your work. Um um uh so uh the the uh way I came across this was that I was observing two different personalities in patients that there was when they came in they were very symptomatic and immature. they got better and they were like very normal, healthy, mature people and then they'd regress and they'd revert back to this other personality uh that was immature and troubled and then I was rereading the split brain studies and it seemed like there was a connection uh uh wi with uh the split brain studies which very clearly show that uh uh when you cut the corpus colosum for people with epilepsy uh you get two uh independent minds and um and uh so dualbrain psychology has a lot of research. We've been studying this for 35 years at Harvard and um and the idea is that trauma gets located more in one brain hemisphere than the other and it can be the left or the right side. And we think that the side that the trauma gets located in has to do with uh uh the age of at development when the trauma occurred and the type of trauma. Uh but we're not sure about that. But it does seem that in in um um uh in that most individuals uh the trauma is located on one side and it's easy to stimulate and I'll talk about that and uh and the other side the other uh side is quite healthy and and uh and this leads to uh uh clinical applications where where you uh want treat the troubled side and use the healthy side to as a co-therapist to help treat it and and uh um so let me uh so this is a whole paradigm shift from the usual uh psychiatry that's going on today with the focus on uh pills and and uh DBT T or or cognitive behavior therapy uh that we we try and dig into the trauma that is causing uh the the uh problem. Uh and so we we've used uh in our studies over the years uh a lot of sophisticated uh neuroscience techniques. We've had a lot of clinical trials. Uh right now we're we're studying fentanyl addiction and we have a uh uh uh a two and a half million dollar uh grant from NIH with a FDA breakthrough designation and uh and uh half of it's being done at MLAN hospital and and half at a startup that I have and uh and what I can tell you we we're still blinded but about half the people, so half the people are getting sham and half are getting active and about half the people are doing very well coming off of fentanyl. And these are people who've had multiple overdoses and and uh living um uh a number of them are living on the street and and uh so it's a real hardcore group. uh but in that group we we have many successful uh I I would say at my site uh about a third of the patients are doing quite well uh and and uh a number of people are dropping out or not doing well and and MLAN is finding the same sort of results and we we'll have to become unblinded in the Paul uh our our site is completing the study uh uh in about two weeks. uh the the uh uh the uh clinical applications that I'll describe uh are used in clinical practices and uh and dual brain psychology is the first psychological theory uh and application to come out of rigorous research namely the split brain studies uh which won the Nobel Prize and to be supported by uh 35 years of research mostly at Harvard. Uh so these are the split brain uh experimenters. Sperry uh Roger Sperry in the middle, Joe Bogan and Ran Zidell who work with him. Uh and uh and the idea with this book brain studies is that the uh corpus colosum um uh is um Can you see my cursor? Yep. Uh okay. So so this gets cut to try to treat uh intractable epilepsy. And as a result, if you show something to the uh lateral visual field, in this case it's the left lateral visual field, goes through the lens of the eye, hits the medial retina and crosses over to this side here. And only the right brain can see the image. uh you ask the right brain, the left brain which can speak only the left brain has speech and and he has no idea what was shown and uh and can't pick uh the item out of a box with several items in it. The right brain however with its left hand which is connected to the right brain can very easily pick out the item. Um so Roger Sperry showed a picture to the left lateral visual field and it was only seen by the right brain and the left brain uh she started giggling and the they asked the woman um uh why she was laughing and she had no idea. She confabulated and uh but we know why she was laughing. She saw a a Playboy nude uh uh presented by uh distinguished Robert Roger Sperry and um she thought that was a cause to giggle. Uh and uh the right brain has political opinions. You could show a picture of different political figures like Hitler got a thumbs down and uh one guy could express himself with scramble chips and he said he wanted to be a draftsman in his left brain and his right brain wanted to be a race car driver. And uh and after the operation, the the two hemispheres uh have a very different um uh aspirations and and attitudes and um one person wanted to smoke and his other hand controlled by the other hemisphere kept putting the cigarettes out. One woman wanted to put on a dress and her other hand uh kept unbuttoning it and taking trying to take it off. And so this is a uh setup that's very used. Uh he he'd put a a word on each side of a computer screen and it would only be seen by the opposite brain and so the left brain could speak and it would say uh saw the word brush over here and and uh it would say brush and and the uh right brain could reach behind the screen and pick out the item amongst several items. Uh so I did a study uh with Bogan and Zidell. Uh Sperry had died about two years earlier and um this was the uh I think it was the last split brain study done in California and it was the first one to do a psychological inventory uh of the two hemispheres. And so I asked um uh how much do you feel and two words would come up on the computer screen. One would be uh positive. There were positive words and negative words. So uh and each hemisphere got all of the words uh uh and we had graduate students look at uh pegs where the uh hands would point to a peg. There only four here but there were five answers. It was from none to extreme. And uh and we got very reliable answers. Uh and in one patient uh uh he uh was seemed to be much had a higher opinion of himself in his right hemisphere. And uh uh and he his positive on positive words he scored somewhere between quite a bit and extreme. whereas his left hemisphere uh scored an average of moderate and uh and the the other patient scored similarly in both sides but he told me with his speaking left brain that he'd been bullied as a child and I know that bullying is a serious trauma and uh so I asked him I injected some questions about his being bullied uh uh while I was testing him and u his uh right hand signing for his speaking left brain confirmed that he was not upset by the bullies. He said none none none and and but his right brain signing with his left hand remember in all the other questions they were similar here it was different uh and um uh he the right brain was extremely upset by the bullying even though the the uh uh left brain was not and uh so this is a a picture of Rener Whitling and he's a German scientist who made this elaborate device reporting to show movies to one hemisphere or the other in normal people so people who didn't have surgery and uh and uh it was I had to read the protocol several times till I figured out what he was doing and essentially he was showing the movie using uh eye tracking and masking a computer screen to one lateral visual field or the other. And I and I figured that on my budget uh I could uh do the same thing. Uh and uh so I tried this and I didn't respond. uh I did a few years later and I still do uh to this simple technique and I I'll I'll show you an fMRI study u that supports it. Uh and I asked my first patient that day uh and he was a Viet Vietnam veteran who had PTSD. He was doing well and he got very upset and he said that plant behind you looks like the jungle. I said really? I said, ""Try the other sides very quickly."" And uh and he said, ""Oh, it's a nice looking plant."" And and uh I see this kind of response in about 55% of patients. Uh and about another 30% uh have a s at least a two-point response, two, three, four point response. Uh and about 15% of patients don't respond. Often they do later. Um uh and uh so this is an fMRI study where we put people in the scanner with with taped goggles. So if they looked one way, they could only see out the left lateral visual field or or the right lateral visual field. And and what we see is that blood flow increased in the uh in the contrlateral hemisphere. And so that that this simple intervention of looking out one lateral visual field actually has a a profound effect uh and that people feel differently uh and uh they'll see me either critically or empathically depending on which side they're looking out. their world view changes and and the the view they have out one side is uh of a child uh through a through their traumatized lens. And uh then this is a more modern version of our glasses where you can flip them um and look out the other side. And in therapy sessions, uh, I have people look out one side and and and then the other and we go back and forth and and I talk to two people and one person. And so this is a a sort of a diagram of of the theory of dual brain psychology that one one side is healthy and it could be the right brain that's healthy or it could be the left brain. And the other side could be like this tough guy over here. Um and and u uh and often people come in and they don't know that they have a healthy side and we we demonstrated it for the first time uh and uh and and that the two sides uh are like two different people and they can fight and sabotage each other. they can compete and uh or cooperate. And uh um and so what I call dual brain psychotherapy uh is to to try to treat the troubled side. This is a a guy um uh I want to So it's about two minutes. You're right. Can you hear that? All right. Yeah, I can hear it. So, um, how much would you pay to go to my casino in the back? So, here's a gambling issue. 600. I had a picture of an angry man on the screen. Yeah. Now I'm I'm not hearing anything anymore now. What about 1100? I'm screwed that up. Uh Uh, so when I had him look out the other side, uh, he wouldn't pay me anything to go to my casino. So, we'll go to the next. I'm sorry. Um, um, so I got him up to $2,000 on one side. Let's turn up the volume here. Okay, we'll just go to the next slide. Okay, so then another guy after I made this discovery with um with my hands, I made tape goggles like I we saw in the scanner and I had a guy who I treated um u come back and try them and and he did very well. He had a cocaine addiction and uh and it turned out that uh his father uh was always demeaning towards him and um uh and so he put the glasses on. He looks out one side and he says, ""I don't know. I was never comfortable around my father with these glasses on."" It's sort of uh like dealing with with him again because it's always the unknown and it's always a pressure and a problem. Yeah. You feel the unknown. You have the tension. Then he looks out the other side. All he's doing is he's just looking from one side to the other. And it happens in seconds. Uh I can deal with him on this side. I know how to handle him now. And I don't think he'd get me upset. And I wouldn't do the counterproductive things if I looked at him out this side all the time. I'd feel more pity for him and for the relationship. And I don't think I'd want to abuse myself by using drugs. Uh and then this is a study where we did an fMRI study and we found that um uh people who had a a left positive hemisphere uh had a large reward center nucleus encumbent, a small fear center amydala and and a larger hippocampus on the left than the right side and worse on people who had right hemisphere positive. And uh uh so this this is just a diagram to to uh it's not to scale. Uh but I want to show too that there are two hippocampons. Uh there's a left hypocampus and a and a right uh uh hypocampus, a left amygdala. And all of the parts uh in the hemisphere are bilateral. And a lot of times people think just speak about the amygdala or the nuclear circumbent. And most researchers don't look at the lateral differences. Um, and then this is a DTI study uh follows the tracks and there were differences uh between left lateral uh left positive and right positive. And then uh we did a study uh with people who got TMS uh for depression. They got a two-eek course of TMS and we put the goggles on as a baseline. asked them to look to the left side and the right side and measure their depression. And those who felt more depressed looking to the right means that their left brain uh was negative. And uh and TMS for for some unknown reason is always treated on the left side. Uh and uh so we predicted that people with a negative left hemisphere would do poorly. And and that's what this shows here. These were people who had a a baseline uh that indicated a negative left hemisphere and there was only one woman who did well. She was left-handed. Uh and the rest this is a very a very poor outcome. And all the people who had a good outcome were predicted to do well. And and over here it shows that uh people who were predicted to do well had a 40% improvement in their depression uh two weeks after their twoe treatment of TMS. And people we predicted to not do well had an 11% uh decrease in depression. That was highly significant. Uh so I wanted another way to stimulate the positive hemisphere. And so uh uh I I thought of using nearfred light and I worked with um uh Michael Hamlin at at the uh Wellman Center at MCH and we did the first um uh treatment using uh transcranial photobiomodulation uh which is using near infrared light through the skull goes into the brain And uh uh we've had no uh uh adverse reactions. I've been doing it for 15 years. Uh at all and um uh and so we've had a number of studies using this and and turns out it's about two to three times stronger generally. Uh and so this is a guy who came in and he wanted a drink. uh he measured at seven of 10 and he'd pay me $500 for a beer and after a 4-minute treatment he he didn't want to pay me anything and I offered it to him for free uh and and he wouldn't accept it and we both laughed. Uh uh uh this is a guy who uh had been abused by an violent father and his I showed him a picture of this angry man that we used and and his leg was bouncing up and down about an inch uh uh per second. And uh I treated him and uh and he stopped shaking. His leg was still and I I just said to him, I said, ""You're not shaking now."" He said, ""No."" and and he measured his decrease in anxiety. It's extreme. Uh and uh this was a a con uh an NIH study that we did. It was a phase one study with 40 subjects. Half were done at Mlane and half at a startup uh that I have. Um and we use unilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation. We use the goggles to to see which side to stimulate. uh and uh uh and we put the light over the positive hemisphere and they don't get any therapy other than this. And so the the placebo group, which was half the group, uh went down uh 1.5 on a 10-point scale of cravings. The active group went down four and a half points. And that's the difference between using and not using. And the effect size was 1.5. The high effect size is 08. So it's sort of two point twice high. And uh we also had a decrease in use that was significant. And uh this is another clinical trial done earlier and um uh we were looked at depression and these were not severely depressed people. Um uh there this is their Hamilton score. I was just just on the cusp of depression but they went down from 15 to 8 uh and also on anxiety went down uh to um uh uh this is 8.8 and eight. This is eight. And uh uh this was with one treatment. Uh they either got a sham or an active treatment. Um uh it was within subject trial. Uh so now we have a new model device. Uh uh one side pulses at one hertz to inhibit the negative hemisphere and the other side is continuous uh to stimulate the positive hemisphere. And we're getting remarkable results with this. I'm running a study on depression now. And uh uh and and and the study isn't completed, but the results uh I'm not I'm it's I'm not blinded here. Uh are are this got a right now it's getting a 65% drop in depression right after the treatment. Uh so dual brain psychotherapy is where I talk to two people and one individual. somebody walking by might think we're crazy. Uh but and I teach the patient how to talk to his troubled personality. And so it's a whole personality on that side. Uh so this is uh my first book and and uh I just want to point out Joe Boen wrote uh and he's he was the neurosurgeon for this book studies. Um uh wonderfully readable, wellinformed. This is the best book ever on the social and psychiatric implications of this book brain research. I'm proud of that. And this is a a new book that I have that's more for the public. Um uh and I just want to show that I've got a lot of papers and uh u uh you can go on my website if if if you want to see it more. So this is where I want to just talk uh and then we can discuss. These are just some ideas about u m that Michael might be interested in. So uh um u in terms of u agency um uh I think an organism or an object must have knowledge and make decisions and learn. But then I ask uh does an agent have to have a subjective experience? And and to me that's an important question. And uh and I think that uh uh human experience comes out of brain information. I think the brain is an information processor and the two hemispheres have different information. Um uh and and the the more terrible the trauma, the more salience it has and and and the harder it is to get through to the person that the trauma might not recur. Um and um uh so the liver functions intelligently but I don't think it has a subjective agency maybe a proto agency and uh uh and the brain within each hemisphere has multiple areas that interact as a collective intelligence. So the amygdala and the nuclear circumbent and the hippocampus and the and the thousands of other areas within a hemisphere act together and and it's a collective intelligence and the two hemispheres uh work together either destructively or or constructively uh uh as a collective intelligence uh and uh general uh problem solvers uh um uh uh need um uh um an obstacle to solve. Uh and uh and uh uh life uh uh seems to uh confer a desire to survive and that can be o overcome at times. um uh but when pain becomes when life becomes too painful but generally uh uh every living thing wants to survive and and strives for that. I think that that's a very important drive and and uh and I think that life has a force. it it uh that it it it has information and uh um knowledge and and I I I think it's a force that's needs to be brought into physics uh more it's left out of physics because it's not mechanical um uh and um uh and some solutions of a general problem solvers are intelligent and others are foolish. Uh so uh all the the solutions that u u uh problem solvers come up with uh aren't um uh progressive or or helpful. Um and that that's why we we get into particularly in um in human life that humans are often very destructive. Another thing I just wanted to uh mention here that might be of interest is that uh why do we degenerate with age and there there's development regeneration and then there's degeneration which I think is an important uh issue that needs to be addressed and u so um um uh both um uh let's see um so it okay information must be understood by the agent. So learning and memory uh required knowledge is often destructive in people. So we we we you know we've been thinking that uh uh learning and and memory is a good thing and often it is good uh but uh but it often uh uh particularly with trauma is disruptive but not just with trauma. It's uh the the human being has has often done uh um um uh things that mention here uh uh um that uh there's a collective intelligence in in society. There are groups of people and and and we select groups uh and the groups have uh boundaries that u uh can move and uh uh and so it starts with the two minds and and and it's our first group and then it's our family and our neighbors and and then maybe people of a similar u uh political persuasion. Uh we often see the outside group as unworthy or threatening and different groups often become hostile and human history including the present is filled with atrocities towards each other and cancer and healthy tissues both fight for survival that cancer wants to live as well as normal tissues. uh and uh some potential experiments. uh I maybe using photobiomodulation as well as uh uh electromagnetic fields or or chemical um um um ways to influence regeneration and and uh and um uh and then I'm interested in xenobox and anthrobots and and uh and and I wonder if they could be used to see um uh uh what happens when uh uh there's a a transformation between life and and death and and and whether um um uh there might be a a sensitive photon detector that that uh uh there might be some experiments that might be interesting uh to study uh the nature of life and uh so um uh that's what I have to to show now. Thanks. Yeah, that's that's great. Um I have a couple of questions. Um maybe I I don't know if I've understood this correctly, but uh so so so since you you said clinically you interact with both personalities. Yeah. The the mature one and the and the troubled one. Does that mean that and and you and you're also saying that they map onto the two hemispheres. Does that mean that both hemispheres can speak because I thought I thought only one of them should have spoken language. Um uh one second here. There we go. Okay. Um so I didn't hear that. Can you repeat that? Okay. If if I understood correctly, you're saying that clinically you can you can you can talk to both personalities, right? That's right. Okay. And and Okay. and and you locate them in the two hemispheres. That's right. Okay. And so the implication is that they both can speak. Um is that I I thought I thought typically only under the standard case only one hemisphere can talk. Right. Well, that's an interesting thing that so if someone's u uh stimulating their right hemisphere by looking out the left lateral visual field, they can move both arms. They can speak. And uh so uh uh the the what I uh conceive of is that this is sort of a meta uh uh uh cognition or it's a in other words we're talking about a personality difference. Um uh it it doesn't it's not a split brain uh where where a person can't move the other side of their body with with with one brain. Uh so they have access to the uh to all of the instruments in the two brains but the personality uh uh and the mind uh that each hemisphere has a separate mind. Okay. And and and so it's sort of regardless of which one is speaking they're using the left typically the left hemisphere's language center to talk something like that. Yeah. Right. I see. And um okay and if you were to what what predictions does it have for example when they do the um the sodium penithol to put one of the hemispheres to sleep for I think it's 20 minutes. Well, actually that's very interesting and and in my book I I cite that that uh that actually most of the time uh uh uh they don't really see an emotional difference but when they do uh it's usually the person feels better uh when one side is put down and it can be either the left or right side and and and and uh and sometimes the person will will get very upset and cry and and so that there can be emotional differences and and uh and it can be either the left brain or the right brain that that is more negative is crying or or is happy but with with with the uh water test. I see. And um yeah, got it. and and in patients that either I mean there are rare patients that have that only have one hemisphere or sometimes people do a hemispherectomy. What are the what are the implications then for this kind of thing? Uh well I haven't I've never seen such a patient uh but in the literature uh sometimes there's a personality change. I don't know they don't really discuss clearly uh the direction of the change. Uh but the the uh the the thing that is most impressive is that they're human beings. So you can be a human being who's in who can uh appear as a normal human being with one hemisphere. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I agree. I think that's remarkable. Um, we reviewed uh a number of cases and I'm sure I'm sure you've heard of them, but I wonder what you think where you you've got these rare patients who have drastically reduced brain volume in both hemispheres, but yet they have normal normal or even above normal cognitive performance. Right. Right. Although I I I think that um uh in animals the larger the brain usually the more intelligent except that in in some animals like parrots or octopus uh they they have they have very they have more functioning than you'd expect from the smallsiz brain. Yeah. Right. You know, t typically there certainly seems to be a relationship of course, but but you've got these occasional, you know, exceptional cases that say that it's not actually required, right? Yeah. And and what do you think about um evolutionarily uh this phenomenon you describe of the two personalities in the two hemispheres? H how what what is the you know sort of in in homminid ancestry and so on? Where how how where does this come from? when when do you think it it it first becomes notable noticeable? Uh I don't know. Uh I I think that um in development I think the healthy hemisphere seems to develop more later. Uh and um um uh and uh and it it might be that it's to rescue the person, but it it often doesn't get expressed. But when when uh when the uh when a negative hemisphere, if a child, for example, has a mother who who says, ""You're a loser and you'll never amount to anything."" And then he go and that's a trauma. And then he goes to school and he can't learn because he's going to school with a trauma. And then and then the teacher yells at him because he didn't do his homework and he becomes truent and and and he gets in with with a a bad group of kids. And then he gets into drugs or alcohol and and and and drops out of college and and all these things are cumulative and and and um humiliating. And he may never know uh uh till he he comes into my office that that he he has an intelligent side to him that that is uh less impaired and if I give him a light treatment uh he feels really good for the first time. It's it's it's these are really exciting things that we're seeing. Uh but I don't uh you know some people have said well maybe two minds are better than one and I I don't know uh uh but but all animals even flies uh have a duality in their hemispheres and uh and it might be just to have a a duplication in case one fails. um uh I I don't know but why why trauma would get located in in one hemisphere I I I'm not sure and uh uh and the other thing that I I don't have an explanation for is that when the uh uh eye blocking occurs just like this uh it happens in in in seconds that I'll have them look at a picture and the guy looks more scary and and he looks out the other side and and he he doesn't look threatening and and uh or sometimes a person will look at me out one side and I'll look critical like their mother was and out the other side I look like an empathic therapist and and uh uh so it really is like it's not just uh uh that their anxiety is more on one side or it's just one dimension uh but it's it's really a whole view of the world and the view of the world out the negative side is is the view of a child who's been traumatized and yeah very interesting and and and what do you think uh is the situation in in clinical cases where they seem to be much more than two personalities what's happening well I um when I published my first book I became friendly with a a psych ologist from New Jersey and and um and he had a practice filled with um uh patients with uh dissociative identity disorder, which is what they now call the multiple personalities. And what he found was that when he used my uh goggles um that all of the immature personalities were on one side and and all of the mature personalities were on the other side. And the same thing happened with um uh Richard Schwarz who who developed what's called internal family systems. It's a very popular therapy that's used. And his theory is that in the mind you have a whole uh family of uh of different personalities and he talks to them and uh and when he tried my goggles uh his patients felt better on one side and and worse on the other. And uh uh so uh I I don't have much experience with um u u multiple personalities. I I had one patient and and she was just too difficult for me to treat. She had profound trauma and she couldn't relate to me well and she found another therapist in New Hampshire and I was glad that she got some help. Uh but um uh these are people who were severely traumatized. Uh and um um uh uh but uh but I I I do think that um um uh that the uh that the younger personalities seem to be lateralized. Yeah. and and and one of the things that's most interesting to me is the way the the two sides uh fight each other and and and uh and a lot of times someone will go well uh and and the immature side gets upset and fights back and says, you know, you want me to go out on disability? You know, the hell with you. and and and uh and so sometimes getting well becomes a problem that we have to deal with. Uh and um so so you have some surprise reactions. It's not all uh that if a person's doing well, it's all good and they continue to do well. Yeah. But but in the end they most patients do very well and so Okay. And so that's I'm wondering about that. What's the um the best case scenario uh in the case of someone who is you know as as good as a human is going to get what what is the what is the situation there? What what's happening with with the with the two personalities there? Um well uh I I I can talk with my experience. I I had uh trauma as a child and uh uh and um when I was in college uh it they reared up and I had to get a lot of therapy and and uh and and and deal with it. And sometimes u u uh in the middle of the night uh uh Freddy will wake me up and I have to go down and talk to him. And um and and what I do in in my psychotherapy is I we we talk with in sort of a Socratic way to the troubled mind and and uh was it actually your fault? And and uh are you an alcoholic? And is that how you're defined? Uh sort of as um um u and you can never get you can never be well or do you have trauma that that alcohol became a solution for and uh and if we treat the trauma will the alcohol uh problem get resolved and and so there there are different perspectives. I don't know if I answered your question. Got lost there. Yeah. Well, I'm thinking I I just I I always with these things, I always try to think about what um uh what's the what's the the the most healthy case possible? So, what what does it look like when somebody has Okay. Yeah. Right. So, so, uh, I think with me, uh, I think, uh, uh, Freddy helps me and he works with me, but he's still a little boy and, uh, uh, and and I think he helps me as a therapist, you know, I can empathize better and, uh, uh, and so we work together and and and uh, and he's we're good friends and and uh, so I that that's the uh the best outcome. I think there there are people I've never had a neurologist put the goggles on and have a reaction and I think that maybe their two hemispheres are uh you know perfect or or maybe they're repressed. I don't know uh why why that is. What's interesting uh when I do podcasts uh I always ask the podcaster to try it. uh uh you can just get like a a letter or a a credit card and and do it and uh and they always respond and it becomes an interesting part of the discussion. Uh and uh so these are people who um uh uh are uh well functioning uh but but they're still carrying with them uh a side that's uh got got trauma and I think it's just that the healthier side it leads most of the time. Is it do you think it's possible but just broadly speaking does anybody become an adult? Obviously, it's a it's a spectrum. Some trauma is horrific and some is less so. But does does anybody become an adult without trauma? Is it avoidable? Is there such a thing as a background as a upbringing that doesn't include it? Uh I I I think that is and that may be a deficit in a way. In other words, it may be that there there are people who um um don't lack a certain depth because they haven't experienced adversity and and in our lab at MLAN Dr. Tisher has has talked about uh inoculation from trauma and uh uh but um uh but clearly there are people who who uh are are not suffering trauma but trauma also is pretty ubiquitous and the way I define trauma is very broad. I think it's whatever hurts you and and so it might be uh I I think that I harm my daughter who's very successful and doing well and we good marriage and grandchildren and and uh but uh I think that um we'd be playing dolls and and then I'd have to go to work and and and and uh and I think my you know working so much um uh was a trauma and and uh um and you know we had to work that out and we we have a great relationship now but but uh when she was in high school there was u she was very rebellious towards me and and uh and I think was expressing uh some of her pain. So, it wasn't, you know, that I was I was my intention was not to traumatize her, but but uh I also had a career that I was invested in and and uh uh and I I so I I think trauma can be disguised and and often a patient will come in and they have no idea that they suffered some trauma and and the kind of trauma that they suffered um usually was uh something that can be recognized as trauma. But sometimes it's just, you know, maybe a sibling was more successful or or um um a parent was ill. Uh and uh so so these can be traumas that aren't recognized ordinarily as trauma that you know combat is or blood and guts or you know are obvious traumas and and I see that as well. you I see both. Do you think that um is there is there a is there any kind of a possible world? So let's say you know if people didn't need to go to work and they you know that kind of thing, right? If you if you remove all of those kind of contingent requirements, is there any sort of upbringing that results in an adult that has basically zero of that and does not need any sort of therapeutic intervention at all? Or do you think that's an impossibility just based on uh you know living in in a community and having other people who don't do everything you want them to do and things like that? Is it is there any such thing as as an adult who doesn't need you know I don't know therapy psychoanalysis whatever it is is it even possible um probably not because uh and and if we look around uh there's so much um uh there's so many atrocities that the human being u um u uh commits uh and we see that even today or you know this poor woman who who from TUS was was, you know, taken uh uh by unmarked ICE agents and and uh um uh that um uh the human being isn't right generally. you know, there there's a just a a lot of um um hostility that occurs between people and and and uh and and whether it's just a limited resources uh that causes these fights or whether uh there's something about the the uh need for uh acquiring more wealth and and and and uh uh prestige uh that that causes the the aggression And uh but but um um you know the the you know human history is rife with uh humans killing other human beings. [Music] Yeah. and and also we were also rife with um u about half the people in a in a survey that was done recently suffer um a mental disorder during their lifetime. That's half the people in the globe. Sorry, say it again. Suffer what what kind of disorder? Well, uh it wasn't clear. It just said a mental disorder. Oh, mental disorder. and and um um and most of those uh last a lifetime or a lot of them. And so so there's a lot of mental suffering that goes on uh uh aside from uh human aggression just within uh the aggression within the person. A lot of, you know, suicidal behavior uh has to do with one side trying to kill the other side. And uh and and so uh the the conflicts within a person uh are often cause severe pain. And uh and of course uh different groups of uh of people you know competing uh uh with each other and having hostility towards each other uh causes great pain. So so the human being has done some wonderful and and beautiful things and has also done a lot of foolish things and destructive things. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. And one thing I should note uh in our right right now we're studying uh fentanyl addiction and and we're studying uh 130 uh participants half of which get active and half get shame and they only get the light treatment. And um and right now we're still blinded, but um uh a large number of of these individuals are coming off of fentanol. Get a little water here. And so they're coming off a fentanyl and their lives are doing well. They're feeling better and um and all we're doing is stimulating or what we believe we're doing is stimulating their healthier hemisphere. Uh and and we we determine which is the healthier hemisphere by this visual technique. And uh so it it may be that the sham treatment uh is getting the better results, but we don't believe that at this point. We think that um uh and in our phase one study u I I showed the results there uh that that uh the statistics were off the chart and and that uh the the cravings and use went down in in the people who got the active treatment, not the sham. and and I'm doing a study right now with with a new device for depression and and uh and and the results with that are amazing. So this is just you know stimulating the positive hemisphere. Now that doesn't last the light treatment will last about three days and and um and and and that can vary. It can be a little longer in some people and less in others and but uh but it seems to be stronger. uh but does the same thing as the visual technique and and it's just it's a four-minute light treatment that we're using in in our fentanyl study. And and to have someone who has had multiple overdoses uh come in and they might be homeless and and and come off of fentanyl, it's it's pretty amazing. And uh and and what determines the um uh you know the length of like why is it that number of minutes versus something else? Like how did you how did you settle on the number of minutes? Well, I I think it might be too conservative. What we uh we were excuse me we were concerned uh that we didn't want to do harm. So uh and so um we were reasoning that if we uh didn't hurt the skin, we wouldn't hurt the brain because the light uh decreases uh um um exponentially uh as as it goes into the brain. So about 6% of the uh intensity of the light reaches the brain. So the so if you're not hurting the skin, you're probably not going to hurt the brain. and we haven't seen any uh adverse reactions. Uh we've had a couple cases of the flu, but we don't think they're related to um uh we had to write them up. Uh you know, adverse reactions, but um we don't we haven't seen any that we think were related to the device, and I haven't seen any in my practice where where I use it under IRB supervision. Mhm. And um um uh so what we wanted to do was to make sure we didn't harm the skin and and there's a uh they're very conservative standards for using light on the skin and we uh followed those standards. Uh but compared to other researchers in the field, we're using a higher dose of light than than others. But um uh we we think it's very conservative and and we probably could uh be giving a longer treatment uh than than we are. But we'd have to study that. So right now uh the FDA has determined that our our device and procedure has no significant risk. Um yeah.","So this is a novel theory of um cerebral laterality and psychopathology and uh and and and I I think it has relevance to your work. Um um uh so uh the the uh way I came across this was that I was observing two different personalities in patients that there was when they came in they were very symptomatic and immature. they got better and they were like very normal, healthy, mature people and then they'd regress and they'd revert back to this other personality uh that was immature and troubled and then I was rereading the split brain studies and it seemed like there was a connection uh uh wi with uh the split brain studies which very clearly show that uh uh when you cut the corpus colosum for people with epilepsy uh you get two uh independent minds and um and uh so dualbrain psychology has a lot of research. We've been studying this for 35 years at Harvard and um and the idea is that trauma gets located more in one brain hemisphere than the other and it can be the left or the right side.

And we think that the side that the trauma gets located in has to do with uh uh the age of at development when the trauma occurred and the type of trauma. Uh but we're not sure about that. But it does seem that in in um um uh in that most individuals uh the trauma is located on one side and it's easy to stimulate and I'll talk about that and uh and the other side the other uh side is quite healthy and and uh and this leads to uh uh clinical applications where where you uh want treat the troubled side and use the healthy side to as a co-therapist to help treat it and and uh um so let me uh so this is a whole paradigm shift from the usual uh psychiatry that's going on today with the focus on uh pills and and uh DBT T or or cognitive behavior therapy uh that we we try and dig into the trauma that is causing uh the the uh problem.

Uh and so we we've used uh in our studies over the years uh a lot of sophisticated uh neuroscience techniques. We've had a lot of clinical trials. Uh right now we're we're studying fentanyl addiction and we have a uh uh uh a two and a half million dollar uh grant from NIH with a FDA breakthrough designation and uh and uh half of it's being done at MLAN hospital and and half at a startup that I have and uh and what I can tell you we we're still blinded but about half the people, so half the people are getting sham and half are getting active and about half the people are doing very well coming off of fentanyl. And these are people who've had multiple overdoses and and uh living um uh a number of them are living on the street and and uh so it's a real hardcore group.

Uh but in that group we we have many successful uh I I would say at my site uh about a third of the patients are doing quite well uh and and uh a number of people are dropping out or not doing well and and MLAN is finding the same sort of results and we we'll have to become unblinded in the Paul uh our our site is completing the study uh uh in about two weeks.

Uh the the uh uh the uh clinical applications that I'll describe uh are used in clinical practices and uh and dual brain psychology is the first psychological theory uh and application to come out of rigorous research namely the split brain studies uh which won the Nobel Prize and to be supported by uh 35 years of research mostly at Harvard.

Uh so these are the split brain uh experimenters. Sperry uh Roger Sperry in the middle, Joe Bogan and Ran Zidell who work with him. Uh and uh and the idea with this book brain studies is that the uh corpus colosum um uh is um Can you see my cursor?

Yep.

Uh okay. So so this gets cut to try to treat uh intractable epilepsy. And as a result, if you show something to the uh lateral visual field, in this case it's the left lateral visual field, goes through the lens of the eye, hits the medial retina and crosses over to this side here. And only the right brain can see the image. Uh you ask the right brain, the left brain which can speak only the left brain has speech and and he has no idea what was shown and uh and can't pick uh the item out of a box with several items in it. The right brain however with its left hand which is connected to the right brain can very easily pick out the item.

Um so Roger Sperry showed a picture to the left lateral visual field and it was only seen by the right brain and the left brain uh she started giggling and the they asked the woman um uh why she was laughing and she had no idea. She confabulated and uh but we know why she was laughing. She saw a a Playboy nude uh uh presented by uh distinguished Robert Roger Sperry and um she thought that was a cause to giggle.

Uh and uh the right brain has political opinions. You could show a picture of different political figures like Hitler got a thumbs down and uh one guy could express himself with scramble chips and he said he wanted to be a draftsman in his left brain and his right brain wanted to be a race car driver.

And uh and after the operation, the the two hemispheres uh have a very different um uh aspirations and and attitudes and um one person wanted to smoke and his other hand controlled by the other hemisphere kept putting the cigarettes out. One woman wanted to put on a dress and her other hand uh kept unbuttoning it and taking trying to take it off.

And so this is a uh setup that's very used. Uh he he'd put a a word on each side of a computer screen and it would only be seen by the opposite brain and so the left brain could speak and it would say uh saw the word brush over here and and uh it would say brush and and the uh right brain could reach behind the screen and pick out the item amongst several items.

Uh so I did a study uh with Bogan and Zidell. Uh Sperry had died about two years earlier and um this was the uh I think it was the last split brain study done in California and it was the first one to do a psychological inventory uh of the two hemispheres. And so I asked um uh how much do you feel and two words would come up on the computer screen. One would be uh positive. There were positive words and negative words.

So uh and each hemisphere got all of the words uh uh and we had graduate students look at uh pegs where the uh hands would point to a peg. There only four here but there were five answers. It was from none to extreme. And uh and we got very reliable answers. Uh and in one patient uh uh he uh was seemed to be much had a higher opinion of himself in his right hemisphere. And uh uh and he his positive on positive words he scored somewhere between quite a bit and extreme.

Whereas his left hemisphere uh scored an average of moderate and uh and the the other patient scored similarly in both sides but he told me with his speaking left brain that he'd been bullied as a child and I know that bullying is a serious trauma and uh so I asked him I injected some questions about his being bullied uh uh while I was testing him and u his uh right hand signing for his speaking left brain confirmed that he was not upset by the bullies. He said none none none and and but his right brain signing with his left hand remember in all the other questions they were similar here it was different uh and um uh he the right brain was extremely upset by the bullying even though the the uh uh left brain was not and uh so this is a a picture of Rener Whitling and he's a German scientist who made this elaborate device reporting to show movies to one hemisphere or the other in normal people so people who didn't have surgery and uh and uh it was I had to read the protocol several times till I figured out what he was doing and essentially he was showing the movie using uh eye tracking and masking a computer screen to one lateral visual field or the other.

And I and I figured that on my budget uh I could uh do the same thing. Uh and uh so I tried this and I didn't respond. Uh I did a few years later and I still do uh to this simple technique and I I'll I'll show you an fMRI study u that supports it. Uh and I asked my first patient that day uh and he was a Viet Vietnam veteran who had PTSD. He was doing well and he got very upset and he said that plant behind you looks like the jungle.

I said really? I said, ""Try the other sides very quickly."" And uh and he said, ""Oh, it's a nice looking plant."" And and uh I see this kind of response in about 55% of patients. Uh and about another 30% uh have a s at least a two-point response, two, three, four point response. Uh and about 15% of patients don't respond. Often they do later.

Um uh and uh so this is an fMRI study where we put people in the scanner with with taped goggles. So if they looked one way, they could only see out the left lateral visual field or or the right lateral visual field. And and what we see is that blood flow increased in the uh in the contrlateral hemisphere. And so that that this simple intervention of looking out one lateral visual field actually has a a profound effect uh and that people feel differently uh and uh they'll see me either critically or empathically depending on which side they're looking out. Their world view changes and and the the view they have out one side is uh of a child uh through a through their traumatized lens.

And uh then this is a more modern version of our glasses where you can flip them um and look out the other side. And in therapy sessions, uh, I have people look out one side and and and then the other and we go back and forth and and I talk to two people and one person.

And so this is a a sort of a diagram of of the theory of dual brain psychology that one one side is healthy and it could be the right brain that's healthy or it could be the left brain. And the other side could be like this tough guy over here. Um and and u uh and often people come in and they don't know that they have a healthy side and we we demonstrated it for the first time uh and uh and and that the two sides uh are like two different people and they can fight and sabotage each other. They can compete and uh or cooperate.

And uh um and so what I call dual brain psychotherapy uh is to to try to treat the troubled side. This is a a guy um uh I want to So it's about two minutes. You're right. Can you hear that?

All right.

Yeah, I can hear it. So, um, how much would you pay to go to my casino in the back? So, here's a gambling issue. 600. I had a picture of an angry man on the screen. Yeah. Now I'm I'm not hearing anything anymore now. What about 1100? I'm screwed that up. Uh Uh, so when I had him look out the other side, uh, he wouldn't pay me anything to go to my casino. So, we'll go to the next. I'm sorry.

Um, um, so I got him up to $2,000 on one side. Let's turn up the volume here. Okay, we'll just go to the next slide.

Okay, so then another guy after I made this discovery with um with my hands, I made tape goggles like I we saw in the scanner and I had a guy who I treated um u come back and try them and and he did very well. He had a cocaine addiction and uh and it turned out that uh his father uh was always demeaning towards him and um uh and so he put the glasses on. He looks out one side and he says, ""I don't know. I was never comfortable around my father with these glasses on."" It's sort of uh like dealing with with him again because it's always the unknown and it's always a pressure and a problem. Yeah. You feel the unknown. You have the tension. Then he looks out the other side. All he's doing is he's just looking from one side to the other. And it happens in seconds. Uh I can deal with him on this side. I know how to handle him now. And I don't think he'd get me upset. And I wouldn't do the counterproductive things if I looked at him out this side all the time. I'd feel more pity for him and for the relationship. And I don't think I'd want to abuse myself by using drugs.

Uh and then this is a study where we did an fMRI study and we found that um uh people who had a a left positive hemisphere uh had a large reward center nucleus encumbent, a small fear center amydala and and a larger hippocampus on the left than the right side and worse on people who had right hemisphere positive.

And uh uh so this this is just a diagram to to uh it's not to scale. Uh but I want to show too that there are two hippocampons. Uh there's a left hypocampus and a and a right uh uh hypocampus, a left amygdala. And all of the parts uh in the hemisphere are bilateral. And a lot of times people think just speak about the amygdala or the nuclear circumbent. And most researchers don't look at the lateral differences.

Um, and then this is a DTI study uh follows the tracks and there were differences uh between left lateral uh left positive and right positive.

And then uh we did a study uh with people who got TMS uh for depression. They got a two-eek course of TMS and we put the goggles on as a baseline. Asked them to look to the left side and the right side and measure their depression. And those who felt more depressed looking to the right means that their left brain uh was negative.

And uh and TMS for for some unknown reason is always treated on the left side. Uh and uh so we predicted that people with a negative left hemisphere would do poorly. And and that's what this shows here. These were people who had a a baseline uh that indicated a negative left hemisphere and there was only one woman who did well. She was left-handed. Uh and the rest this is a very a very poor outcome. And all the people who had a good outcome were predicted to do well. And and over here it shows that uh people who were predicted to do well had a 40% improvement in their depression uh two weeks after their twoe treatment of TMS. And people we predicted to not do well had an 11% uh decrease in depression. That was highly significant.

Uh so I wanted another way to stimulate the positive hemisphere. And so uh uh I I thought of using nearfred light and I worked with um uh Michael Hamlin at at the uh Wellman Center at MCH and we did the first um uh treatment using uh transcranial photobiomodulation uh which is using near infrared light through the skull goes into the brain And uh uh we've had no uh uh adverse reactions. I've been doing it for 15 years. Uh at all and um uh and so we've had a number of studies using this and and turns out it's about two to three times stronger generally.

Uh and so this is a guy who came in and he wanted a drink. Uh he measured at seven of 10 and he'd pay me $500 for a beer and after a 4-minute treatment he he didn't want to pay me anything and I offered it to him for free uh and and he wouldn't accept it and we both laughed.

Uh uh uh this is a guy who uh had been abused by an violent father and his I showed him a picture of this angry man that we used and and his leg was bouncing up and down about an inch uh uh per second. And uh I treated him and uh and he stopped shaking. His leg was still and I I just said to him, I said, ""You're not shaking now."" He said, ""No."" and and he measured his decrease in anxiety. It's extreme.

Uh and uh this was a a con uh an NIH study that we did. It was a phase one study with 40 subjects. Half were done at Mlane and half at a startup uh that I have. Um and we use unilateral transcranial magnetic stimulation. We use the goggles to to see which side to stimulate. Uh and uh uh and we put the light over the positive hemisphere and they don't get any therapy other than this. And so the the placebo group, which was half the group, uh went down uh 1.5 on a 10-point scale of cravings. The active group went down four and a half points. And that's the difference between using and not using. And the effect size was 1.5. The high effect size is 08. So it's sort of two point twice high. And uh we also had a decrease in use that was significant.

And uh this is another clinical trial done earlier and um uh we were looked at depression and these were not severely depressed people. Um uh this is their Hamilton score. I was just just on the cusp of depression but they went down from 15 to 8 uh and also on anxiety went down uh to um uh uh this is 8.8 and eight. This is eight. And uh uh this was with one treatment. Uh they either got a sham or an active treatment. Um uh it was within subject trial.

Uh so now we have a new model device. Uh uh one side pulses at one hertz to inhibit the negative hemisphere and the other side is continuous uh to stimulate the positive hemisphere. And we're getting remarkable results with this. I'm running a study on depression now. And uh uh and and and the study isn't completed, but the results uh I'm not I'm it's I'm not blinded here. Uh are are this got a right now it's getting a 65% drop in depression right after the treatment.

Uh so dual brain psychotherapy is where I talk to two people and one individual. Somebody walking by might think we're crazy. Uh but and I teach the patient how to talk to his troubled personality. And so it's a whole personality on that side.

Uh so this is uh my first book and and uh I just want to point out Joe Boen wrote uh and he's he was the neurosurgeon for this book studies. Um uh wonderfully readable, wellinformed. This is the best book ever on the social and psychiatric implications of this book brain research. I'm proud of that. And this is a a new book that I have that's more for the public. Um uh and I just want to show that I've got a lot of papers and uh u uh you can go on my website if if if you want to see it more.

So this is where I want to just talk uh and then we can discuss. These are just some ideas about u m that Michael might be interested in. So uh um u in terms of u agency um uh I think an organism or an object must have knowledge and make decisions and learn. But then I ask uh does an agent have to have a subjective experience? And and to me that's an important question. And uh and I think that uh uh human experience comes out of brain information. I think the brain is an information processor and the two hemispheres have different information.

Um uh and and the the more terrible the trauma, the more salience it has and and and the harder it is to get through to the person that the trauma might not recur. Um and um uh so the liver functions intelligently but I don't think it has a subjective agency maybe a proto agency and uh uh and the brain within each hemisphere has multiple areas that interact as a collective intelligence. So the amygdala and the nuclear circumbent and the hippocampus and the and the thousands of other areas within a hemisphere act together and and it's a collective intelligence and the two hemispheres uh work together either destructively or or constructively uh uh as a collective intelligence uh and uh general uh problem solvers uh um uh uh need um uh um an obstacle to solve.

Uh and uh and uh uh life uh uh seems to uh confer a desire to survive and that can be o overcome at times. Um uh but when pain becomes when life becomes too painful but generally uh uh every living thing wants to survive and and strives for that. I think that that's a very important drive and and uh and I think that life has a force. It it uh that it it it has information and uh um knowledge and and I I I think it's a force that's needs to be brought into physics uh more it's left out of physics because it's not mechanical um uh and um uh and some solutions of a general problem solvers are intelligent and others are foolish.

Uh so uh all the the solutions that u u uh problem solvers come up with uh aren't um uh progressive or or helpful. Um and that that's why we we get into particularly in um in human life that humans are often very destructive. Another thing I just wanted to uh mention here that might be of interest is that uh why do we degenerate with age and there there's development regeneration and then there's degeneration which I think is an important uh issue that needs to be addressed and u so um um uh both um uh let's see um so it okay information must be understood by the agent. So learning and memory uh required knowledge is often destructive in people.

So we we we you know we've been thinking that uh uh learning and and memory is a good thing and often it is good uh but uh but it often uh uh particularly with trauma is disruptive but not just with trauma. It's uh the the human being has has often done uh um um uh things that mention here uh uh um that uh there's a collective intelligence in in society. There are groups of people and and and we select groups uh and the groups have uh boundaries that u uh can move and uh uh and so it starts with the two minds and and and it's our first group and then it's our family and our neighbors and and then maybe people of a similar u uh political persuasion.

Uh we often see the outside group as unworthy or threatening and different groups often become hostile and human history including the present is filled with atrocities towards each other and cancer and healthy tissues both fight for survival that cancer wants to live as well as normal tissues.

Uh and uh some potential experiments. Uh I maybe using photobiomodulation as well as uh uh electromagnetic fields or or chemical um um um ways to influence regeneration and and uh and um uh then I'm interested in xenobox and anthrobots and and uh and and I wonder if they could be used to see um uh uh what happens when uh uh there's a a transformation between life and and death and and and whether um um uh there might be a a sensitive photon detector that that uh uh there might be some experiments that might be interesting uh to study uh the nature of life and uh so um uh that's what I have to to show now.

Thanks.

Yeah, that's that's great. Um I have a couple of questions. Um maybe I I don't know if I've understood this correctly, but uh so so so since you you said clinically you interact with both personalities.

Yeah.

The the mature one and the and the troubled one. Does that mean that and and you and you're also saying that they map onto the two hemispheres. Does that mean that both hemispheres can speak because I thought I thought only one of them should have spoken language.

Um uh one second here. There we go. Okay. Um so I didn't hear that. Can you repeat that?

Okay. If if I understood correctly, you're saying that clinically you can you can you can talk to both personalities, right?

That's right.

Okay. And and Okay. and and you locate them in the two hemispheres.

That's right.

Okay. And so the implication is that they both can speak. Um is that I I thought I thought typically only under the standard case only one hemisphere can talk.

Right. Well, that's an interesting thing that so if someone's u uh stimulating their right hemisphere by looking out the left lateral visual field, they can move both arms. They can speak. And uh so uh uh the the what I uh conceive of is that this is sort of a meta uh uh uh cognition or it's a in other words we're talking about a personality difference. Um uh it it doesn't it's not a split brain uh where where a person can't move the other side of their body with with with one brain. Uh so they have access to the uh to all of the instruments in the two brains but the personality uh uh and the mind uh that each hemisphere has a separate mind.

Okay. And and and so it's sort of regardless of which one is speaking they're using the left typically the left hemisphere's language center to talk something like that.

Yeah.

Right. I see. And um okay and if you were to what what predictions does it have for example when they do the um the sodium penithol to put one of the hemispheres to sleep for I think it's 20 minutes.

Well, actually that's very interesting and and in my book I I cite that that uh that actually most of the time uh uh uh they don't really see an emotional difference but when they do uh it's usually the person feels better uh when one side is put down and it can be either the left or right side and and and and uh and sometimes the person will will get very upset and cry and and so that there can be emotional differences and and uh and it can be either the left brain or the right brain that that is more negative is crying or or is happy but with with with the uh water test.

I see. And um yeah, got it. and and in patients that either I mean there are rare patients that have that only have one hemisphere or sometimes people do a hemispherectomy. What are the what are the implications then for this kind of thing?

Uh well I haven't I've never seen such a patient uh but in the literature uh sometimes there's a personality change. I don't know they don't really discuss clearly uh the direction of the change. Uh but the the uh the the thing that is most impressive is that they're human beings. So you can be a human being who's in who can uh appear as a normal human being with one hemisphere.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean I agree. I think that's remarkable. Um, we reviewed uh a number of cases and I'm sure I'm sure you've heard of them, but I wonder what you think where you you've got these rare patients who have drastically reduced brain volume in both hemispheres, but yet they have normal normal or even above normal cognitive performance.

Right. Right. Although I I I think that um uh in animals the larger the brain usually the more intelligent except that in in some animals like parrots or octopus uh they they have they have very they have more functioning than you'd expect from the smallsiz brain.

Yeah. Right. You know, t typically there certainly seems to be a relationship of course, but but you've got these occasional, you know, exceptional cases that say that it's not actually required, right?

Yeah.

And and what do you think about um evolutionarily uh this phenomenon you describe of the two personalities in the two hemispheres? H how what what is the you know sort of in in homminid ancestry and so on? Where how how where does this come from? When when do you think it it it first becomes notable noticeable?

Uh I don't know. Uh I I think that um in development I think the healthy hemisphere seems to develop more later. Uh and um um uh and uh and it it might be that it's to rescue the person, but it it often doesn't get expressed. But when when uh when the uh when a negative hemisphere, if a child, for example, has a mother who who says, ""You're a loser and you'll never amount to anything."" And then he go and that's a trauma. And then he goes to school and he can't learn because he's going to school with a trauma. And then and then the teacher yells at him because he didn't do his homework and he becomes truent and and and he gets in with with a a bad group of kids. And then he gets into drugs or alcohol and and and and drops out of college and and all these things are cumulative and and and um humiliating. And he may never know uh uh till he he comes into my office that that he he has an intelligent side to him that that is uh less impaired and if I give him a light treatment uh he feels really good for the first time. It's it's it's these are really exciting things that we're seeing.

Uh but I don't uh you know some people have said well maybe two minds are better than one and I I don't know uh uh but but all animals even flies uh have a duality in their hemispheres and uh and it might be just to have a a duplication in case one fails. Um uh I I don't know but why why trauma would get located in in one hemisphere I I I'm not sure and uh uh and the other thing that I I don't have an explanation for is that when the uh uh eye blocking occurs just like this uh it happens in in in seconds that I'll have them look at a picture and the guy looks more scary and and he looks out the other side and and he he doesn't look threatening and and uh or sometimes a person will look at me out one side and I'll look critical like their mother was and out the other side I look like an empathic therapist and and uh uh so it really is like it's not just uh uh that their anxiety is more on one side or it's just one dimension uh but it's it's really a whole view of the world and the view of the world out the negative side is is the view of a child who's been traumatized and yeah very interesting and and and what do you think uh is the situation in in clinical cases where they seem to be much more than two personalities what's happening.

Well I um when I published my first book I became friendly with a a psych ologist from New Jersey and and um and he had a practice filled with um uh patients with uh dissociative identity disorder, which is what they now call the multiple personalities. And what he found was that when he used my uh goggles um that all of the immature personalities were on one side and and all of the mature personalities were on the other side. And the same thing happened with um uh Richard Schwarz who who developed what's called internal family systems. It's a very popular therapy that's used. And his theory is that in the mind you have a whole uh family of uh of different personalities and he talks to them and uh and when he tried my goggles uh his patients felt better on one side and and worse on the other.

And uh uh so uh I I don't have much experience with um u u multiple personalities. I I had one patient and and she was just too difficult for me to treat. She had profound trauma and she couldn't relate to me well and she found another therapist in New Hampshire and I was glad that she got some help. Uh but um uh these are people who were severely traumatized. Uh and um um uh uh but uh but I I I do think that um um uh that the uh that the younger personalities seem to be lateralized.

Yeah. And and and one of the things that's most interesting to me is the way the the two sides uh fight each other and and and uh and a lot of times someone will go well uh and and the immature side gets upset and fights back and says, you know, you want me to go out on disability? You know, the hell with you. And and and uh and so sometimes getting well becomes a problem that we have to deal with. Uh and um so so you have some surprise reactions. It's not all uh that if a person's doing well, it's all good and they continue to do well.

Yeah. But but in the end they most patients do very well and so Okay. And so that's I'm wondering about that. What's the um the best case scenario uh in the case of someone who is you know as as good as a human is going to get what what is the what is the situation there? What what's happening with with the with the two personalities there?

Um well uh I I I can talk with my experience. I I had uh trauma as a child and uh uh and um when I was in college uh it they reared up and I had to get a lot of therapy and and uh and and and deal with it. And sometimes u u uh in the middle of the night uh uh Freddy will wake me up and I have to go down and talk to him. And um and and what I do in in my psychotherapy is I we we talk with in sort of a Socratic way to the troubled mind and and uh was it actually your fault? And and uh are you an alcoholic? And is that how you're defined? Uh sort of as um um u and you can never get you can never be well or do you have trauma that that alcohol became a solution for and uh and if we treat the trauma will the alcohol uh problem get resolved and and so there there are different perspectives. I don't know if I answered your question. Got lost there.

Yeah. Well, I'm thinking I I just I I always with these things, I always try to think about what um uh what's the what's the the the most healthy case possible? So, what what does it look like when somebody has Okay.

Yeah. Right. So, so, uh, I think with me, uh, I think, uh, uh, Freddy helps me and he works with me, but he's still a little boy and, uh, uh, and and I think he helps me as a therapist, you know, I can empathize better and, uh, uh, and so we work together and and and uh, and he's we're good friends and and uh, so I that that's the uh the best outcome. I think there there are people I've never had a neurologist put the goggles on and have a reaction and I think that maybe their two hemispheres are uh you know perfect or or maybe they're repressed. I don't know uh why why that is. What's interesting uh when I do podcasts uh I always ask the podcaster to try it. Uh uh you can just get like a a letter or a a credit card and and do it and uh and they always respond and it becomes an interesting part of the discussion. Uh and uh so these are people who um uh uh are uh well functioning uh but but they're still carrying with them uh a side that's uh got got trauma and I think it's just that the healthier side it leads most of the time.

Is it do you think it's possible but just broadly speaking does anybody become an adult? Obviously, it's a it's a spectrum. Some trauma is horrific and some is less so. But does does anybody become an adult without trauma? Is it avoidable? Is there such a thing as a background as a upbringing that doesn't include it?

Uh I I I think that is and that may be a deficit in a way. In other words, it may be that there there are people who um um don't lack a certain depth because they haven't experienced adversity and and in our lab at MLAN Dr. Tisher has has talked about uh inoculation from trauma and uh uh but um uh but clearly there are people who who uh are are not suffering trauma but trauma also is pretty ubiquitous and the way I define trauma is very broad. I think it's whatever hurts you and and so it might be uh I I think that I harm my daughter who's very successful and doing well and we good marriage and grandchildren and and uh but uh I think that um we'd be playing dolls and and then I'd have to go to work and and and and uh and I think my you know working so much um uh was a trauma and and uh um and you know we had to work that out and we we have a great relationship now but but uh when she was in high school there was u she was very rebellious towards me and and uh and I think was expressing uh some of her pain. So, it wasn't, you know, that I was I was my intention was not to traumatize her, but but uh I also had a career that I was invested in and and uh uh and I I so I I think trauma can be disguised and and often a patient will come in and they have no idea that they suffered some trauma and and the kind of trauma that they suffered um usually was uh something that can be recognized as trauma. But sometimes it's just, you know, maybe a sibling was more successful or or um um a parent was ill. Uh and uh so so these can be traumas that aren't recognized ordinarily as trauma that you know combat is or blood and guts or you know are obvious traumas and and I see that as well. You I see both.

Do you think that um is there is there a is there any kind of a possible world? So let's say you know if people didn't need to go to work and they you know that kind of thing, right? If you if you remove all of those kind of contingent requirements, is there any sort of upbringing that results in an adult that has basically zero of that and does not need any sort of therapeutic intervention at all? Or do you think that's an impossibility just based on uh you know living in in a community and having other people who don't do everything you want them to do and things like that? Is it is there any such thing as as an adult who doesn't need you know I don't know therapy psychoanalysis whatever it is is it even possible?

Um probably not because uh and and if we look around uh there's so much um uh there's so many atrocities that the human being u um u uh commits uh and we see that even today or you know this poor woman who who from TUS was was, you know, taken uh uh by unmarked ICE agents and and uh um uh that um uh the human being isn't right generally. You know, there there's a just a a lot of um um hostility that occurs between people and and and uh and and whether it's just a limited resources uh that causes these fights or whether uh there's something about the the uh need for uh acquiring more wealth and and and and uh uh prestige uh that that causes the the aggression And uh but but um um you know the the you know human history is rife with uh humans killing other human beings.

[Music]

Yeah. And and also we were also rife with um u about half the people in a in a survey that was done recently suffer um a mental disorder during their lifetime. That's half the people in the globe.

Sorry, say it again. Suffer what what kind of disorder?

Well, uh it wasn't clear. It just said a mental disorder.

Oh, mental disorder. And and um um and most of those uh last a lifetime or a lot of them. And so so there's a lot of mental suffering that goes on uh uh aside from uh human aggression just within uh the aggression within the person. A lot of, you know, suicidal behavior uh has to do with one side trying to kill the other side. And uh and and so uh the the conflicts within a person uh are often cause severe pain. And uh and of course uh different groups of uh of people you know competing uh uh with each other and having hostility towards each other uh causes great pain. So so the human being has done some wonderful and and beautiful things and has also done a lot of foolish things and destructive things.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. And one thing I should note uh in our right right now we're studying uh fentanyl addiction and and we're studying uh 130 uh participants half of which get active and half get shame and they only get the light treatment. And um and right now we're still blinded, but um uh a large number of of these individuals are coming off of fentanol. Get a little water here. And so they're coming off a fentanyl and their lives are doing well. They're feeling better and um and all we're doing is stimulating or what we believe we're doing is stimulating their healthier hemisphere. Uh and and we we determine which is the healthier hemisphere by this visual technique. And uh so it it may be that the sham treatment uh is getting the better results, but we don't believe that at this point. We think that um uh and in our phase one study u I I showed the results there uh that that uh the statistics were off the chart and and that uh the the cravings and use went down in in the people who got the active treatment, not the sham. And and I'm doing a study right now with with a new device for depression and and uh and and the results with that are amazing. So this is just you know stimulating the positive hemisphere. Now that doesn't last the light treatment will last about three days and and um and and and that can vary. It can be a little longer in some people and less in others and but uh but it seems to be stronger. Uh but does the same thing as the visual technique and and it's just it's a four-minute light treatment that we're using in in our fentanyl study. And and to have someone who has had multiple overdoses uh come in and they might be homeless and and and come off of fentanyl, it's it's pretty amazing.

And uh and and what determines the um uh you know the length of like why is it that number of minutes versus something else? Like how did you how did you settle on the number of minutes?

Well, I I think it might be too conservative. What we uh we were excuse me we were concerned uh that we didn't want to do harm. So uh and so um we were reasoning that if we uh didn't hurt the skin, we wouldn't hurt the brain because the light uh decreases uh um um exponentially uh as as it goes into the brain. So about 6% of the uh intensity of the light reaches the brain. So the so if you're not hurting the skin, you're probably not going to hurt the brain. And we haven't seen any uh adverse reactions. Uh we've had a couple cases of the flu, but we don't think they're related to um uh we had to write them up. Uh you know, adverse reactions, but um we don't we haven't seen any that we think were related to the device, and I haven't seen any in my practice where where I use it under IRB supervision.

Mhm.

And um um uh so what we wanted to do was to make sure we didn't harm the skin and and there's a uh they're very conservative standards for using light on the skin and we uh followed those standards. Uh but compared to other researchers in the field, we're using a higher dose of light than than others. But um uh we we think it's very conservative and and we probably could uh be giving a longer treatment uh than than we are. But we'd have to study that. So right now uh the FDA has determined that our our device and procedure has no significant risk.

Um yeah."
Healing Trauma Fast! with Dr. Schiffer's Dual Brain Psychology Therapy Method,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQKdT7_TxCM,hello welcome to live with Dr jod and we're going to be talking about dual brain Psychology today I have a special guest here Dr Schiffer uh his name is Fred and he is a psychiatrist he's an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School he's a researcher inventor and an author of a a book coming out this fall it's called goodbye anxiety depression addiction and PTSD the life changing science of dual brain psychology I've been reading about this dual brain psychology since I booked Dr shiffer on the show um and today he'll share with us how the brain works what happens when we experience trauma and all about this dual brain psychology so and how it could help with depression with anxiety with PTSD and with addiction so let's get started welcome Fred it's so nice to meet you today hi nice to meet you uh so uh why don't I start off with a a brief explanation of what dual brain psychology is so i' love that dual brain psychology is the first psychological theory to come out of uh rigorous experimentation uh specifically the Dual brain studies of the 1960s uh and um uh and to be tested rigorously uh at harm Harvard uh at mlan hospital uh with um uh high-tech um uh modalities and and and also clinical trials and so it's it's it's a theory that has uh to my knowledge it's the only theory that has been sort of scientifically tested and and uh and the the premise uh of dual brain psychology is that trauma very broadly defined uh as whatever hurts us uh especially in early childhood uh gets associated with one brain hemisphere or the other either the left brain or the right brain and U uh that we commonly think that the right brain is negative and in many ways it is uh but in in what I'm doing uh it seems that we have two minds we have a mind that comes out of the left brain and out of the right brain and and the uh uh one of these Minds is more affected by past traumas and so it's more troubled and has more symptoms and and more behaviors that are that are troubled can I answer a question how do you explain or how do you understand doing after doing all this work which side it is because you said when we have when we experience trauma or something that hurts us it could either be lodged I don't know what you said lodged or or in one side or the other how does it pick which one to do or how did how do you understand how that happen well the the answer is that I don't understand it okay me neither and uh uh it might have something to do with uh the type of trauma and the timing of trauma in development um it seems to me that the healthier side seems to develop uh more in in late adolescence early adulthood and that younger children don't seem to have it as much um when you see the healthier side it could be a different side for each person it is yeah but but for but for a given person uh it's the same side uh okay so it's the one that the trauma hasn't lodged in or some TR that's true like what if you have more than one experience is it always just put in the same side yeah yeah it's um uh what I can show you is uh how we um so this is my equipment as so I'll ask a patient to get their equipment and uh and if you block uh the that here I'm blocking my right eye and now the middle of my left eye and it's important that I'm not looking out the whole left eye but half the left eye so I'm looking out my left lateral visual field and uh and with fmri studies which show uh the blood flow in that in the brain hemisphere uh we we have found that when we do this it actually activates the opposite brain it has to do with the way the eyes are connected into the brain and and uh and if I go like this uh I activate my left brain and and so the first time that I tried this and and I won't go into uh how I came to do this but I was using my hands as going like this and I didn't respond uh uh and I asked a patient who was a Vietnam veteran uh to try it and he had had um uh four tours of Duty and a Purple Heart had severe PTSD which was doing he was doing quite well uh but he looked at his uh right lateral visual field which would stimulate his left brain and he got very upset and he said that plant behind you looks like the jungle and so I saw that he's having a flashback so uh I I I immediately said well uh look out the other side side and and he did and he and he smiled and he said oh that's a nice looking plan and and um and I see this every day and and uh about 55% of my patients have these really intense responses and and so like I could try it right now yeah I don't have I mean I I've done so much work on myself and I don't feel like I have too much so Nothing's Gonna maybe nothing's gonna come up but really want to try this so if I look out halfway through yeah that's perfect good and then look into the world yeah that uh sort of intensified a little bit so let me ask you to think of something upsetting uh uh maybe a childhood trauma or or whatever uh and um and it and it the response is very quick so I could ask you to measure your distress from zero to 10 I didn't I didn't have much I I guess so it was low so let me try the other side would say like two maybe okay because I was trying to think of something terrible okay okay so same same thing maybe a little bit higher but maybe I maybe I maybe it's a maybe my trauma is healed um yeah I triy to think of the most awful thing I could think of okay well that's good and and it's good that you didn't respond and and I've never seen a neurologist respond whatever that means uh so uh so it could be that your two hemispheres are are getting along well and and and uh uh uh and uh but uh it' be be interesting to try it in your practice and and and see if uh if you find a difference and then what I can do is I can talk to two people so in someone who's having a response like this Vietnam vet uh uh I'll look uh critical on on one side and and and I don't look just kind of randomly critical but I look critical like his mother was and and he doesn't like himself and if he has drug Cravings uh they increase and out the other side I I look like uh empathic therapist so you appear to him you mean yeah I thought at first when you're saying at one side I look critical like I thought you were looking critically at that side but you mean you uh he to you to him you appear like his critical like a his mother like the energy of his mother and on the other side you're an empathic therapist or psychiatrist right so it's not just a like um a pain or or craving uh it's it's really a whole view that's why I call it of two minds that yeah that a brain the whole like the whole like um like rose-colored glasses or trauma colored glasses yeah it's a different person and they both have the same address and the same social security number even the same birthday uh but uh I can they they're very different when I talk to them and uh uh and sometimes one of the problems that I encounter is that the troubled side doesn't want to give up power and he's been in power in running things for 30 years and using drugs or alcohol or whatnot and and uh and he and he sort of is saying you want me to uh retire and go in disability to hell with you you know and and uh so a lot of the therapy is kind of in negotiating and working with the trouble side to to try to show it that um uh cooperating with the other side could be helpful the other side could help you and and the healthy side becomes a co-therapist in in dual brain Psychotherapy I see yeah okay so you're so it's a uh so you're trying to converse with the the happier side or the preferred side or the feeling good side and how do you use that side to try to heal the other side a couple of things one is that it it's very clarifying uh when they if for instance if if uh I uh the feelings he has about me lead to the trauma then that becomes very clear and that uh uh that that's why he s and so so so the technique is very clarifying in terms of uh what's going on psychologically and and um and I I I work with both sides so I try and encourage the adult side to be more present and um um uh I I have a phys patient who's a physician and I and I say calling doctor so and so you know and I try and Rouse her up uh and and and uh and she'll do well if if there's a a crisis or a need and and and her strong side comes out but she also has a very depressed uh uh troubled side and um uh and and I try and get her healthy side to be like a good parent and to talk with her and and and help her and would to be a co-therapist so the the the real aim of the therapy is is is the treatment of the troubled side I see yeah and the trauma that that it had and but you find that you know using uh aligning and with that good side or that I don't want I'm trying not to use like good bad but um because it is a a healthy and a neurotic side yeah right right so it's like a preferred side and a a troubled side know that but because I want words that are changeable you know yeah um because that the troubl side could get untroubled yeah and and that's the aim of the therapy is to make it untroubled it's going to remain a child but uh I think of as like a corporation so it needs to get out of the corner office and and go into marketing or research you know and uh yeah do something that it's more capable of and cooperate with with the other side so you wrote this book goodbye anxiety depression addiction and PTSD and I thought this is really interesting because it's very based in this you know the therapy the work in the therapy session of how to use it and it it doesn't sound like it's a prescription you know you do this a protocol right it's is a listed out stuff so that's really hard to write a book when it's when it's something that you've been um um you know in the Moment casee by case trying to understand something and and and work something out how did you put that in a book and it's a self-help book right it's not for therapists well it's no it's for therapists um uh it's hard to connect with therapists so that that therapists often uh you know have their own way of doing things and and uh and so it's I find I find that it's it's it's hard sometimes to bring in a new idea especially one that is coming from Left Field you know and um but it's for therapists uh and and it's for ordinary people and it's for uh intelligent readers who want to know more about how the mind works so so in the book there are uh narrative fictional depictions that are accurate depictions of a therapy session and and so they're about five of those in the book and uh and they give a good feeling for how I work with the patient and have you done trainings like do you train other therapists and is there a bunch of people doing it what if somebody is wants to what if they watch this interview and they're like I need this this just where would they go uh well uh it's hard to uh get an audience uh for for it and and so maybe after my book comes out uh uh there'll be more of a demand uh for training so I'd like to train people because I think it's a it's it's it's very empowering I think my patients get better more quickly than they used to and and and uh and I think the the Improvement is more solid and last it lasts a long time yeah yeah how how how long have you been using it in your practice how long have you been using dual brain psychology when did you call it that like you're the person who named it right right uh so uh that day in my office was really the birth of dual brain psychology with with the Vietnam vet yeah and that was in 1995 okay and you have a Private Practice still up in Massachusetts right and and I I know you do a lot of different things but that is one of your right we're running NIH study to treat fentanyl addiction okay and uh and we're using a special LED that we developed at Mass General uh and we put it over the positive hemisphere to simulate it and we're a light I was reading about that as well people don't know LED is he's talking about the light bulb LED right uh but it's a LED it's a it's a super super luminous LED that we had manufactured and and uh uh and so you point it towards someone's forehead you put it either over here or over here depending on which is the the the uh the more mature side okay because you're it's com you're using the Dual brain psychology and knowing which side is the mature side or the healthier side and then you put the light on which side say that again the positive side the the light so the the visual technique crosses over the light goes through the skull and into the brain and has no side effects that we've encountered it could you know in in the future uh but we haven't seen any uh side effects and and the FDA has uh determined that it has no significant risk uh but what it does do that the light does stimulate the healthy your mind and the person feels better and and um and if I give a one study that I'm just submitting uh yes please I was gonna ask good I'm sorry yeah I said yes please I was gonna ask like could you give us some stats like what have you noticed um well in in the study that I just submitted uh I did a Beck depression uh scale which is a good measure of depression it's easy to administer uh before and after immediately after a treatment and um and and there were marked improvements uh one one person had a depression score of 34 which is very high and after a treatment went down to four now he's an outlier uh uh and but most people uh uh you know they they'll ask for a light treatment can I you know can I get a light sh back and um uh and and treat when we don't have to do any work right it just is like can we have some of those easy things that we just said and we get better without having to do any hard work like that well I've not that I'm saying that like happily yeah uh uh that in the uh we're treating fentanyl addiction now fentanyl is is you know very hard to treat it's hard to get the people and and and the group uh uh many of the PE half people are getting a sham device which is a placebo but half the group are doing extremely well and have stop their fentol or decreased it 70 80% uh and uh uh and a couple of people who finish a study it's a six-month study so they want to dye their hair and come back as a uh another candidate uh yeah I was wondering like sometimes the ethics of research when people are getting so much much better yeah and the people who are the control group are not or at risk that that does bring into it's an ethical U problem and and it's painful but but uh it's it's the way the FDA works yeah I know you were just want to give it to everybody if it's helping you do yeah and and hopefully one day I'll be able to yeah um yeah wonderful because I think the the you know overdose problem is growing everywhere and there is not enough uh response to that I think there's there's a lot of a lot of agencies you know I've been talking to some people locally about um you know how hard it is to do that work like how to get support for that to you know to harm reduction or um you know how to help people who are hard to you know they don't come in right they're not going to come in to the hospital Center and you know we need more mobile clinics and to to reach them and so I really appreciate this and I'm G to share it with my colleagues and also integrate it with the Psychotherapy and also I have um uh uh what I call Dr schiffer's uh stress reduction sunglasses and they they are like the envelope only you can see through do it and uh uh and and they're effective and and my I I think all my patients use them okay so you're saying you have like sunglasses that take like three fours of your vision out yeah leaving just partial the the healthy side so my right would be my left if my left was my healthy side um and so they spend some parts of their day with these on to be more and more connected to that healthy side yeah that's right interesting yeah and also I I have used the negative side so we can talk to the troubled side okay and so you can have it there in a a sort of a stable way and and and longer conversation like in controlled situations where you're practice now let's do this healing now yeah okay that's it's very exciting it's very exciting stuff yeah and the and the real treatment for the trauma is it's the same old thing it's that you have to uh grieve it and bear it and and process it and uh and not be so terrified of it and and uh uh and um uh sorry um uh and uh so that's the real treatment is is to treat the trauma you know and and we do that we get the best results that's great okay so yes so then is a is a you know you you go to talk therapy but the talk therapy itself is so much more effective because you're really uh you know you're getting at you're you're being able to use that healthy part of the brain or this Tech this uh I keep wanting to call it dual brain technology instead of dual brain psychology but it's a a similar uh concept but very exciting and then the light using the light um that is really really exciting Stefan I was picturing you said they come in for the group or I think you were talking about the control group and then the the group that was getting um the research group uh I was thinking that if you brought people in for a group and they did the light first and then were able to talk to each other or do a group therapy session how much more impactful would that therapy section that's where my mind went when you were talking about it how much more impactful would they if they were like in the waiting room and they did the light and then they came in um would their their openness or responsiveness to the conversation be different um after having that light it can be again there's a lot of variation and it's it's a therapy session so it's sort of like a soccer game you know you you from wherever the ball is sort of um but um in that patient who uh went from 34 to 4 uh sometimes he'll come in and he's just depressed and he has nothing to talk about and and everything the world is is bad and I'll say you know you look like a man who needs a light treatment and uh and so I'll give it to him and uh and then uh his demeanor changes and and and we can work on his problems that which we couldn't before he he had suffered horrible trauma and uh and and and that's sort of the problem that when the trauma is really severe uh that uh uh the that immature part tends to hold on uh and and use a repetition compulsion and thinks like a child yeah of of of course yeah the these effect is so so huge um you don't have a copy of your book to hold up I I saw you photo yeah thank you it just we'll put it down below a link to it but of course if you want to hold up the book oh the other side yeah the other side there we go oh that's great goodbye I love that you know you know my my book's called anxiety I'm so done with you so they're really similar um you know like goodbye anxiety um good riddens you know I I like that book title like goodbye anxiety because it's personified those problems as well which kind of you know kind of disconnects it with our identity so we have a and I also feel that all these diagnoses are destructive you know to call somebody borderline or bipolar or uh or addict you know that they're all demeaning and they become a new trauma and absolutely they you know they take on those identity conclusions yep and it's all and it's all due to uh early trauma that kind of snowballs and and and that really is is not demeaning yeah yeah I think so too I I like to say you know it's a reaction to trauma because I I really my biggest message is reminding to to let people know that what they feel is a regular human response to our world or experience it's not a mental illness and it's not an inherent problem or you know the way your brain's wired it is a response it's a regular human response to uh to the world and your experiences and whatever and I think that's really helpful for people and I think the problem is that if uh if you know what you're afraid of if if some you know if your neighbor is threatening you um uh that we call fear but somebody comes in with a panic attack or you know they come in they say I've got an anxiety disorder uh they don't understand what they're afraid of and and what we do is we trace it back through their feelings to to arrive at the trauma and and where the anxiety is what the anxiety is really about is is the old trauma that the little boy or the little girl inside uh can't uh trust that that he's not going to be back in Vietnam or or he's not that he's not still in Vietnam yeah yeah that's beautiful work that you do I'm so glad to have this interview we could go on and on and maybe I'd have you on again I was kind of think we we didn't know each other before we did this so this is nice this might be the start of a a connect a professional connection for us and I'd love to have you on again and I'm thinking it' be great to have somebody with us that you could you know be practicing so we could see it live with permissions obviously but um so it's it's very exciting to hear about this I love new things that could help me help people because that's what I do all the time you know um to really help people know that they are more than they think they are you know in in this moment and we could help them realize that or or bring that out or self-actualize and so um there's so much hope for healing even if you've had horrible trauma and so I think this interview proves it and there's good people out there uh if people want to get in touch with Dr Schiffer his website is dual psychology wait dual brain psychology.com I'm going to put it below dual brain psychology.com you can find him on LinkedIn at his name uh I'll put that down below too and you're not in any other socials uh do um I am but I don't know exactly how to find Once the book goes out you probably have to figure that all out but um yeah so well thank you so much any last words for um for our audience um uh well it's a pleasure meeting you and for the audience I think uh uh that you need to consider that there might be a reason why you're upset uh right rather than uh you know you've got some undiscovered genetic problem and and and and that if you can follow your feelings and get in touch with that and get some help to to help uncover it and work on it beautiful thank you so much thank you and thank you all for watching live with Dr jod uh if you're watching the recording

remember you are so much more than you think you are [Music],"hello welcome to live with Dr jod and we're going to be talking about dual brain Psychology today. I have a special guest here Dr Schiffer uh his name is Fred and he is a psychiatrist. He's an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, he's a researcher, inventor, and an author of a a book coming out this fall. It's called goodbye anxiety depression addiction and PTSD the life changing science of dual brain psychology.

I've been reading about this dual brain psychology since I booked Dr shiffer on the show um and today he'll share with us how the brain works, what happens when we experience trauma and all about this dual brain psychology so and how it could help with depression, with anxiety, with PTSD and with addiction. So let's get started.

welcome Fred it's so nice to meet you today
hi nice to meet you uh so uh why don't I start off with a a brief explanation of what dual brain psychology is so i' love that

dual brain psychology is the first psychological theory to come out of uh rigorous experimentation uh specifically the Dual brain studies of the 1960s uh and um uh and to be tested rigorously uh at harm Harvard uh at mlan hospital uh with um uh high-tech um uh modalities and and and also clinical trials and so it's it's it's a theory that has uh to my knowledge it's the only theory that has been sort of scientifically tested and and uh and the the premise uh of dual brain psychology is that trauma very broadly defined uh as whatever hurts us uh especially in early childhood uh gets associated with one brain hemisphere or the other either the left brain or the right brain and U uh that we commonly think that the right brain is negative and in many ways it is uh but in in what I'm doing uh it seems that we have two minds we have a mind that comes out of the left brain and out of the right brain and and the uh uh one of these Minds is more affected by past traumas and so it's more troubled and has more symptoms and and more behaviors that are that are troubled

can I answer a question how do you explain or how do you understand doing after doing all this work which side it is because you said when we have when we experience trauma or something that hurts us it could either be lodged I don't know what you said lodged or or in one side or the other how does it pick which one to do or how did how do you understand how that happen
well the the answer is that I don't understand it okay me neither and uh uh it might have something to do with uh the type of trauma and the timing of trauma in development um it seems to me that the healthier side seems to develop uh more in in late adolescence early adulthood and that younger children don't seem to have it as much

when you see the healthier side it could be a different side for each person
it is yeah but but for but for a given person uh it's the same side uh
okay so it's the one that the trauma hasn't lodged in or some TR that's true like what if you have more than one experience is it always just put in the same side
yeah yeah it's um uh what I can show you is uh how we um so this is my equipment as so I'll ask a patient to get their equipment and uh and if you block uh the that here I'm blocking my right eye and now the middle of my left eye and it's important that I'm not looking out the whole left eye but half the left eye so I'm looking out my left lateral visual field and uh and with fmri studies which show uh the blood flow in that in the brain hemisphere uh we we have found that when we do this it actually activates the opposite brain it has to do with the way the eyes are connected into the brain and and uh and if I go like this uh I activate my left brain and and so the first time that I tried this and and I won't go into uh how I came to do this but I was using my hands as going like this and I didn't respond uh uh and I asked a patient who was a Vietnam veteran uh to try it and he had had um uh four tours of Duty and a Purple Heart had severe PTSD which was doing he was doing quite well uh but he looked at his uh right lateral visual field which would stimulate his left brain and he got very upset and he said that plant behind you looks like the jungle and so I saw that he's having a flashback so uh I I I immediately said well uh look out the other side and and he did and he and he smiled and he said oh that's a nice looking plan and and um and I see this every day and and uh about 55% of my patients have these really intense responses and and so like I could try it right now

yeah I don't have I mean I I've done so much work on myself and I don't feel like I have too much so Nothing's Gonna maybe nothing's gonna come up but really want to try this so if I look out halfway through
yeah that's perfect good and then look into the world
yeah that uh sort of intensified a little bit so let me ask you to think of something upsetting uh uh maybe a childhood trauma or or whatever uh and um and it and it the response is very quick so I could ask you to measure your distress from zero to 10
I didn't I didn't have much I I guess so it was low so let me try the other side would say like two maybe
okay because I was trying to think of something terrible
okay okay so same same thing maybe a little bit higher but maybe I maybe I maybe it's a maybe my trauma is healed um yeah I triy to think of the most awful thing I could think of
okay well that's good and and it's good that you didn't respond and and I've never seen a neurologist respond whatever that means uh so uh so it could be that your two hemispheres are are getting along well and and and uh uh uh and uh but uh it'd be be interesting to try it in your practice and and and see if uh if you find a difference and then what I can do is I can talk to two people so in someone who's having a response like this Vietnam vet uh uh I'll look uh critical on on one side and and and I don't look just kind of randomly critical but I look critical like his mother was and and he doesn't like himself and if he has drug Cravings uh they increase and out the other side I I look like uh empathic therapist

so you appear to him you mean
yeah I thought at first when you're saying at one side I look critical like I thought you were looking critically at that side but you mean you uh he to you to him you appear like his critical like a his mother like the energy of his mother and on the other side you're an empathic therapist or psychiatrist right
so it's not just a like um a pain or or craving uh it's it's really a whole view that's why I call it of two minds that
yeah that a brain the whole like the whole like um like rose-colored glasses or trauma colored glasses
yeah it's a different person and they both have the same address and the same social security number even the same birthday uh but uh I can they they're very different when I talk to them and uh uh and sometimes one of the problems that I encounter is that the troubled side doesn't want to give up power and he's been in power in running things for 30 years and using drugs or alcohol or whatnot and and uh and he and he sort of is saying you want me to uh retire and go in disability to hell with you you know and and uh so a lot of the therapy is kind of in negotiating and working with the trouble side to to try to show it that um uh cooperating with the other side could be helpful the other side could help you and and the healthy side becomes a co-therapist in in dual brain Psychotherapy

I see yeah okay so you're so it's a uh so you're trying to converse with the the happier side or the preferred side or the feeling good side and how do you use that side to try to heal the other side
a couple of things one is that it it's very clarifying uh when they if for instance if if uh I uh the feelings he has about me lead to the trauma then that becomes very clear and that uh uh that that's why he s and so so so the technique is very clarifying in terms of uh what's going on psychologically and and um and I I I work with both sides so I try and encourage the adult side to be more present and um um uh I I have a phys patient who's a physician and I and I say calling doctor so and so you know and I try and Rouse her up uh and and and uh and she'll do well if if there's a a crisis or a need and and and her strong side comes out but she also has a very depressed uh uh troubled side and um uh and and I try and get her healthy side to be like a good parent and to talk with her and and and help her and would to be a co-therapist so the the the real aim of the therapy is is is the treatment of the troubled side

I see yeah and the trauma that that it had and but you find that you know using uh aligning and with that good side or that I don't want I'm trying not to use like good bad but um because it is a a healthy and a neurotic side
yeah right right so it's like a preferred side and a a troubled side know that but because I want words that are changeable you know yeah um because that the troubl side could get untroubled
yeah and and that's the aim of the therapy is to make it untroubled it's going to remain a child but uh I think of as like a corporation so it needs to get out of the corner office and and go into marketing or research you know and uh yeah do something that it's more capable of and cooperate with with the other side

so you wrote this book goodbye anxiety depression addiction and PTSD and I thought this is really interesting because it's very based in this you know the therapy the work in the therapy session of how to use it and it it doesn't sound like it's a prescription you know you do this a protocol right it's is a listed out stuff so that's really hard to write a book when it's when it's something that you've been um um you know in the Moment casee by case trying to understand something and and and work something out how did you put that in a book and it's a self-help book right it's not for therapists
well it's no it's for therapists um uh it's hard to connect with therapists so that that therapists often uh you know have their own way of doing things and and uh and so it's I find I find that it's it's it's hard sometimes to bring in a new idea especially one that is coming from Left Field you know and um but it's for therapists uh and and it's for ordinary people and it's for uh intelligent readers who want to know more about how the mind works so so in the book there are uh narrative fictional depictions that are accurate depictions of a therapy session and and so they're about five of those in the book and uh and they give a good feeling for how I work with the patient

and have you done trainings like do you train other therapists and is there a bunch of people doing it what if somebody is wants to what if they watch this interview and they're like I need this this just where would they go
uh well uh it's hard to uh get an audience uh for for it and and so maybe after my book comes out uh uh there'll be more of a demand uh for training so I'd like to train people because I think it's a it's a it's it's very empowering I think my patients get better more quickly than they used to and and and uh and I think the the Improvement is more solid and last it lasts a long time yeah yeah

how how how long have you been using it in your practice how long have you been using dual brain psychology when did you call it that like you're the person who named it right
right uh so uh that day in my office was really the birth of dual brain psychology with with the Vietnam vet yeah and that was in 1995
okay and you have a Private Practice still up in Massachusetts right and and I I know you do a lot of different things but that is one of your
right we're running NIH study to treat fentanyl addiction okay and uh and we're using a special LED that we developed at Mass General uh and we put it over the positive hemisphere to simulate it and we're a light
I was reading about that as well people don't know LED is he's talking about the light bulb LED right
uh but it's a LED it's a it's a super super luminous LED that we had manufactured and and uh uh and so you point it towards someone's forehead you put it either over here or over here depending on which is the the the uh the more mature side
okay because you're it's com you're using the Dual brain psychology and knowing which side is the mature side or the healthier side and then you put the light on which side say that again
the positive side the the light so the the visual technique crosses over the light goes through the skull and into the brain and has no side effects that we've encountered it could you know in in the future uh but we haven't seen any uh side effects and and the FDA has uh determined that it has no significant risk uh but what it does do that the light does stimulate the healthy your mind and the person feels better and and um and if I give a one study that I'm just submitting uh
yes please I was gonna ask good I'm sorry
yeah I said yes please I was gonna ask like could you give us some stats like what have you noticed
um well in in the study that I just submitted uh I did a Beck depression uh scale which is a good measure of depression it's easy to administer uh before and after immediately after a treatment and um and and there were marked improvements uh one one person had a depression score of 34 which is very high and after a treatment went down to four now he's an outlier uh uh and but most people uh uh you know they they'll ask for a light treatment can I you know can I get a light sh back and um uh and and treat when we don't have to do any work right it just is like can we have some of those easy things that we just said and we get better without having to do any hard work like that

well I've not that I'm saying that like happily yeah uh uh that in the uh we're treating fentanyl addiction now fentanyl is is you know very hard to treat it's hard to get the people and and and the group uh uh many of the PE half people are getting a sham device which is a placebo but half the group are doing extremely well and have stop their fentol or decreased it 70 80% uh and uh uh and a couple of people who finish a study it's a six-month study so they want to dye their hair and come back as a uh another candidate uh
yeah I was wondering like sometimes the ethics of research when people are getting so much much better yeah and the people who are the control group are not or at risk that that does bring into it's an ethical U problem and and it's painful but but uh it's it's the way the FDA works
yeah I know you were just want to give it to everybody if it's helping you do
yeah and and hopefully one day I'll be able to yeah um yeah wonderful because I think the the you know overdose problem is growing everywhere and there is not enough uh response to that I think there's there's a lot of a lot of agencies you know I've been talking to some people locally about um you know how hard it is to do that work like how to get support for that to you know to harm reduction or um you know how to help people who are hard to you know they don't come in right they're not going to come in to the hospital Center and you know we need more mobile clinics and to to reach them and so I really appreciate this and I'm G to share it with my colleagues and also integrate it with the Psychotherapy

and also I have um uh uh what I call Dr schiffer's uh stress reduction sunglasses and they they are like the envelope only you can see through do it and uh uh and and they're effective and and my I I think all my patients use them
okay so you're saying you have like sunglasses that take like three fours of your vision out yeah leaving just partial the the healthy side so my right would be my left if my left was my healthy side um and so they spend some parts of their day with these on to be more and more connected to that healthy side
yeah that's right interesting yeah and also I I have used the negative side so we can talk to the troubled side
okay and so you can have it there in a a sort of a stable way and and and longer conversation like in controlled situations where you're practice now let's do this healing now yeah okay that's it's very exciting it's very exciting stuff yeah and the and the real treatment for the trauma is it's the same old thing it's that you have to uh grieve it and bear it and and process it and uh and not be so terrified of it and and uh uh and um uh sorry um uh and uh so that's the real treatment is is to treat the trauma you know and and we do that we get the best results

that's great okay so yes so then is a is a you know you you go to talk therapy but the talk therapy itself is so much more effective because you're really uh you know you're getting at you're you're being able to use that healthy part of the brain or this Tech this uh I keep wanting to call it dual brain technology instead of dual brain psychology but it's a a similar uh concept but very exciting and then the light using the light um that is really really exciting Stefan I was picturing you said they come in for the group or I think you were talking about the control group and then the the group that was getting um the research group uh I was thinking that if you brought people in for a group and they did the light first and then were able to talk to each other or do a group therapy session how much more impactful would that therapy section that's where my mind went when you were talking about it how much more impactful would they if they were like in the waiting room and they did the light and then they came in um would their their openness or responsiveness to the conversation be different um after having that light
it can be again there's a lot of variation and it's it's a therapy session so it's sort of like a soccer game you know you you from wherever the ball is sort of um but um in that patient who uh went from 34 to 4 uh sometimes he'll come in and he's just depressed and he has nothing to talk about and and everything the world is is bad and I'll say you know you look like a man who needs a light treatment and uh and so I'll give it to him and uh and then uh his demeanor changes and and and we can work on his problems that which we couldn't before he he had suffered horrible trauma and uh and and and that's sort of the problem that when the trauma is really severe uh that uh uh the that immature part tends to hold on uh and and use a repetition compulsion and thinks like a child
yeah of of of course yeah the these effect is so so huge um you don't have a copy of your book to hold up I I saw you photo
yeah thank you it just we'll put it down below a link to it but of course if you want to hold up the book oh the other side yeah the other side there we go oh that's great goodbye I love that you know you know my my book's called anxiety I'm so done with you so they're really similar um you know like goodbye anxiety um good riddens you know I I like that book title like goodbye anxiety because it's personified those problems as well which kind of you know kind of disconnects it with our identity so we have a
and I also feel that all these diagnoses are destructive you know to call somebody borderline or bipolar or uh or addict you know that they're all demeaning and they become a new trauma and absolutely they you know they take on those identity conclusions
yep and it's all and it's all due to uh early trauma that kind of snowballs and and and that really is is not demeaning
yeah yeah I think so too I I like to say you know it's a reaction to trauma because I I really my biggest message is reminding to to let people know that what they feel is a regular human response to our world or experience it's not a mental illness and it's not an inherent problem or you know the way your brain's wired it is a response it's a regular human response to uh to the world and your experiences and whatever and I think that's really helpful for people
and I think the problem is that if uh if you know what you're afraid of if if some you know if your neighbor is threatening you um uh that we call fear but somebody comes in with a panic attack or you know they come in they say I've got an anxiety disorder uh they don't understand what they're afraid of and and what we do is we trace it back through their feelings to to arrive at the trauma and and where the anxiety is what the anxiety is really about is is the old trauma that the little boy or the little girl inside uh can't uh trust that that he's not going to be back in Vietnam or or he's not that he's not still in Vietnam

yeah yeah that's beautiful work that you do I'm so glad to have this interview we could go on and on and maybe I'd have you on again I was kind of think we we didn't know each other before we did this so this is nice this might be the start of a a connect a professional connection for us and I'd love to have you on again and I'm thinking it'd be great to have somebody with us that you could you know be practicing so we could see it live with permissions obviously but um so it's it's very exciting to hear about this I love new things that could help me help people because that's what I do all the time you know um to really help people know that they are more than they think they are you know in in this moment and we could help them realize that or or bring that out or self-actualize and so um there's so much hope for healing even if you've had horrible trauma and so I think this interview proves it and there's good people out there

Healing Trauma Through Dual Brain Psychology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhzpeqjxSxY,"Welcome to Living Chronic, the podcast that explores the realities of living with chronic illness and disability while redefining how we thrive in our personal and professional lives. I'm your host, Brandy Shance, a disabled veteran and chronic illness warrior here to discuss the challenges, triumphs, and untapped potential of life with a chronic condition. Before we dive in, please take a minute to hit the subscribe button on whatever platform you're listening. Now, let's change the way we think about disability together. Hi, this is Brandy Sh and you're listening to Living Chronic. Today, I'm here with Dr. Frederick Schiffer. He is a psychiatrist and author of the books Dual Brain and of Two Minds. So, welcome. And there's actually much longer titles there, but I'm going to make sure to put those in the notes so that I don't mess them up. Uh, but welcome to the show. I'm so happy that you're here. Thank you very much. So I'm I'm really excited you're here because since you know I guess to say everything happened to me. I have done a lot of reading um about the mind the mind body connection. So I've really enjoyed learning more about what you do which is study dual brain. Uh so if you could just tell us a little bit more about that right now. Um, let me let me uh so I have a new book out uh and and uh I'll just plug it here. It's probably coming up backwards, but it's called uh goodbye anxiety, depression, uh addiction, and PTSD, the uh lifechanging science of dual brain psychology. And it's on Amazon. So um uh so uh and the the available next day delivery, too. Yeah. Okay. And my other book is is as as you pointed out, it's called of Two Minds. That's an earlier book. And and uh so um there we go. Okay. I just wanted to straighten that out. Uh so um uh where would you like me to start? Uh well, you know, some of the things that um were so fascinating to me was talking about, you know, that dual brain and treating um the immature, troubled half of the brain. I know you and I talked about doing a couple little tests. Um but, you know, as somebody who who I myself suffer from PTSD, um you know, reading about this particular type of treatment is fascinating. I know, um there's a lot of different ideas out there of ways you could treat PTSD. um cognit cognitive behavioral therapy I think seems to be the one that I hear about the most and of course I've also heard a lot about micro doing um LSD things like that but this you know really seemed very tangible to me probably because I keep reading more about the mindbody connection over the years uh so it just felt very tangible and like something you could really reach out and understand um whereas I think many of us who are not in the medical field hear about some of these these things and think h does that really does that really work what what does that mean but this did feel very tangible to me so why why don't I explain first u uh what my hypothesis is and maybe how I arrived at it and and what the uh treatment uh component of it is um so uh uh I'm a psychiatrist I was trained at Harvard at MLAN hospital and I've stayed there for decades and I'm still there. Um uh and um so I've done about 30 plus years of research with multiple publications and and uh and and and um um and a few books on on on this. Um and the idea is uh my my theory is called dual brain uh psychology and and and it's that I've learned over the years that uh each brain hemisphere can support a separate mind. Now they both have the same social security number and the same address uh and they go by the same name. But if you stimulate and it's easy to stimulate one brain hemisphere or the other, you get a different personality and and um um uh that uh so the the hypothesis based on years of research and and uh and research that has uh supported it with with a lot of imaging studies and clinical trials and serious research. That's unusual for a psychological theory. And um uh the uh so the idea is that trauma is the cause of all of the psychiatric problems that I've encountered. Now it may not be true of the whole world, but it's true of my world. and and that usually people don't realize uh how uh the trauma especially early trauma uh um uh affects them and and it gets stuck in one brain hemisphere and so the result is that uh on one side there's an immature traumatized person and on the other side uh you're the same person but the personality is very different and I'll look different out one side or the other and um and it's it's very easy to stimulate uh one hemisphere or the other with a visual technique and I also use photobiomodulation which we could talk about later but the visual technique is very simple and I'll use my book to demonstrate it. You cover one eye and the middle of the other eye. So, I'm looking out the uh lateral half of of my right eye. And uh so that's my uh uh right lateral visual field. And um and when I first did it, I just used my hands went like this. and and uh uh and I asked uh my first patient to try that and he was a Vietnam veteran who uh had several tours of duty and and had PTSD was doing quite well. But when I asked him to do that, he got very upset and he said, ""That plant behind you looks like the jungle."" And I I said, ""Oh, well, but look out the other side."" And um and he smiled. He said, ""No, it's a nice looking plant."" And uh and so in my practice uh uh when people look out one lateral visual field or the other uh um I can look different. I can look supportive on one side and and critical on the other side like maybe their parent was or someone. And uh and so the focus of dualbrain psychology or is uh to treat the troubled side and and u that usually uh when the patient comes in the two sides are fighting or the the troubled side dominates and doesn't give the health they don't even know they have a healthy side and and uh uh and so the the therapy is to try to talk with the troubled side as in a typical therapy, you know, what are you feeling and what's that remind you of and and and and where we go is to the trauma and and then I try and list the the healthy side uh to be sort of a co-therapist and also is very instructive to the uh patient to be able to with a simple technique feel better and feel no I can handle it and and it reduces their anxiety and their depression uh and um uh so just looking at one side in itself uh is isn't a a a cure uh but it's an aid and and and uh oftentimes if someone's upset about something they can grab an envelope or their hands and and look out that one side and actually make a big change in in their outlook and their feelings and and that's very helpful uh to to to my patients and and and uh to have someone in in your head who can feel good uh is surprising and unexpected and and uh uh and and can show uh the troubled side that there's Oh, and and uh yeah, I thought it was very interesting to to read about um um particularly, you know, again associated with that anxiety because I've been, you know, I I've everybody who listens to my show is very aware of the trauma I experienced in um my medical health. Um I definitely suffered a lot of medical trauma. I also suffer from PTSD from my time during um serving in the army and I have tried various things and I've often said that sometimes I feel like the anxiety is not there. I'm fine and then other days very small things trigger it and I cannot get past it. So learning a bit about dual brain made me think, well, you know, maybe there is maybe I know how to use that other side of my brain and it's just I don't know how to get past the trigger over there. So when you have a patient who who you're going through this with, you know, how do you kind of take that next step to figuring out how to overcome that traumatized side of the brain? Um, uh, okay. I I see the the the two sides as sort of like there was a Steve Martin movie in in the I think it was in the 1980s called The Two of Us. And Lily Tomlin uh uh was with her was meditating with her guru and there was a terrible accident. the the hummingb slipped out of the guru's hands and tumbled down a flight of stairs in in Manhattan. And as a result of this accident, Lily Tomlin's mind got embedded in Steve Martin's brain. And and so you so Steve Martin is the embodiment and and and you see him going like this where where Lily Tomlin wants to go downtown and he wants to go uptown in Manhattan and and uh and she's screaming at him and and he's telling her to shut up and and and this is really what happens in in real people. In other words, the two sides can fight for dominance sometimes. one as I said one one side and usually if you know someone's coming for help they're symptomatic so usually it's a troubled side that's dominating and uh so uh what one of the interesting things is just like uh real people that if someone said to Lily Tomlin don't take that from him you know go on downtown you know it would embolden her and and and if uh Uh if if Steve Martin said, ""Now calm down now. Uh you know, we we need to work together and and uh uh and you know, stop yelling at me."" And and uh uh that um uh you can actually affect uh the hemisphere by talking to it. And I talked to uh each person and and uh and I I actually have uh sunglasses that that were uh uh and that these uh stimulate uh one one hemisphere or the other. If you put them on, they look like normal sunglasses. Uh uh but they actually stimulate one side or the other. And uh so I'll I'll ask the patient to wear them to bring out the uh the troubled side and and talk to it and and um and say, ""Wow, that must have really been difficult."" and and uh uh and uh then we'll flip it to the other side now. Then I'll talk to the healthier side and say that side's really frightened and and you you really need to understand it and and not be angry about it and and uh that it it's not, you know, it's it's misguided and and and and needs needs your help. Um and um so um so how to bring out the healthy side is to be aware that there is a healthy side and and if if it works for you uh use the lateral vision. Uh so um that's um um excuse me that that actually is very powerful and and these glasses are powerful. Uh and uh and I also have an LED that I put on the forehead. It's called photobiomodulation. And uh uh I'm going to set this here so it stops rocking. Okay. Sorry. Um so um uh uh with the photobiomodulation we're doing a study for fentanyl addiction. It's a it's a a large uh NIH study for the FDA and and we're getting uh we think we're getting great results because many of the fentanyl addicts are uh doing well uh both with their dose and and and and they're feeling well and and doing well. Half of the patients get a sham treatment and half get an active treatment. And it's just a four-minute light treatment. There there aren't any uh uh side effects so far. And and I've been doing it actually for 15 years. And and uh and other people are doing it. It's a it's a burgeoning field now. It's called photobiomodulation. But I'm the only person who puts the light over the positive hemisphere. Okay. Once you use the the eye test, I determine which is the positive side. And the light is two or three times more powerful than the um glasses. But the the uh or the eye u maneuver, but the eye maneuver is easier to do. You know, you just put your hands up or put put sunglasses on. And uh so in my practice uh usually by the end of the session I give the person a light treatment and and have a a study go going on right now for depression and getting great results. Yeah. I thought I thought the infrared was very interesting because I I'm familiar with it. You know I I know in infrared sauna. I love an infrared sauna. Right. I've used infrared and other you know I know there's a lot of other ladies out there. We're trying to battle wrinkles. I've got my little infrared light I put on my face to, you know, make me look a little less old. Um, so this idea that it could also help um with my anxiety, with my PTSD, with my depression is pretty fascinating. And I wonder how much, you know, using it on a daily basis, you know, would be able to help just in overall health. Yeah, I actually use it um u almost every day, you know, and I don't have time. I don't but uh yeah, I would say that I I use it about five times a week and and I use it for cognitive enhancement. U so I'm not except when I'm choking now. Um uh uh I'm I'm not uh and I'm not really anxious now, but um um uh so I'm not really very symptomatic, but I I feel that it it gives me a a little cognitive edge, right? And um uh now, but you have to use it on on one side. So, so if you're using the sauna, you're you're you're radiating both sides and that might give some benefit, but you you're also stimulating the troubled side, right? Uh and also your trauma uh was later. In other words, it it the major trauma occurred as an adult and most and so I don't know if it's as lateralized. Most of the people I see uh have dysfunctional families and uh maybe an alcoholic father or a demeaning mother and or a bullying brother. These are the kinds of traumas that I typically see and and they're childhood traumas and they and they seem to get lodged on one side. Did you have a an effect when you tried it looking laterally or or you know I did I kept trying it a few times after we first discussed it and I and I did I tried thinking of a few different things. Um I think I felt a lot when I thought about uh my time in Afghanistan actually. Of course that's been I mean it's 20 you know 20 years on at this point but it doesn't go away but um but it did you know do something. So, uh, I, you know, it certainly made sense to me, you know, I definitely felt, so I was thinking about the time, my time in Afghanistan, like we discussed and I was looking at um, a photo of me and my husband and, you know, we served in the army together, right? And when I covered one side um, you know, everything felt, you know, scary and I started getting really anxious. Um and then the other side and I felt very happy looking at the photo of us. So it was it was stark. It was stark. Okay, that's cool. Okay, so that's a good response. Okay. Uh and um so I always take a risk if I bring it up because I say if someone doesn't respond it sounds, you know, like it's it's a failure. But so you you had a a good response and that's and you can use that. Uh so as you said, you know, if you want to pull up your mature side, you look out that side and and then if you want to talk to the traumatized side, you can uh you know uh look out the the uh the side that stimulates the negative hemisphere. And also I I want to say that we we have a study that we published from MLAN hospital at Harvard uh showing that uh just looking out one lateral visual field or the other. We had people go into an fMRI scanner with goggles that had tape on it and if you looked out one side um it it it covered one eye and you only could see out half the other eye. And then so if you look to the left uh you activated your right visual field and it lit up like a Christmas tree and not the other side was dark. Now, now uh it's not that only one side was working, but we were able to manipulate the data to exaggerate the difference between the sides and and and when we did that, which we were allowed to do because we had a hypothesis. Um uh it it was really a a f fantastic result. And when the patient looked uh to the opposite side, uh the hemisphere switched and and the other side lit up and the other and the uh same the uh same side um uh I don't want to use like ipsolateral side, right? Uh uh was was dark. it's just flipped and and um uh so it's it's a real effect just uh doing this simple maneuver of just you know covering one eye and half the other eye and and if you look out the whole cover one eye and look out one eye it's not going to work because there you're you're stimulating both hemispheres right and and that's why you have to cover uh half of u one eye and look out the lateral portion and um um uh and you know and if you're uh feeling uh distress and it might even help with physical symptoms. I a lot of times uh I'll give someone a light treatment and they'll say my chest pain went away. I didn't even know they were having chest pain. And uh and and one time uh uh and this never happened again, but it was a couple years ago. I had three people in one day who said my hip pain went away and I had them walk downstairs and walk up again and they said, ""No, it feels good."" You know, and uh now it didn't last and it wasn't a a cure. Uh but it was it was interesting, you know. So it it it can affect the the body because the mind is connected to the body. Yeah. Yeah. I think so many especially my listeners you know so many of us have chronic illness you know we've read all the John Earno books Dr. especially, you know, and for good and bad reasons. We have many different, you know, feelings associated with this because sometimes you go to a doctor and they say, ""Well, it's all in your head."" And, you know, no, it's not, doc. I have something very real. I mean, it took me four years to get my diagnosis and turns out it's not in my head at all. Um, but that being said, uh, many of us have been able to use, um, therapy or, um, you know, other means to try to help along with our pain. And I've learned from my own experiences and, you know, reading about this and trying every, you know, I've, you know, basically been at a point where I'll try anything if it might make me feel better. But the the the mind, as much as I want to say that I have this strong, you know, aversion to pain, I can get through anything. I'm chronically ill, um I actually have a very weak tolerance. Um because my mind associates anything with pain at this point. Um everything that has happened to me over the last five years. You know, some I was starting to associate running with pain because every time I tried to run, my joints and muscles seized up and I couldn't move. Uh so I've started to learn that sometimes even though it may not you know the source of my pain was not just in my head but my head associates so many things and I've been able to identify just an absurd list at this point of things that I've gone through that my mind now associates with pain and I sort of recoil like oh gosh this is going to hurt and I suddenly have a very low tolerance for pain as a result. So, um, you know, I think this this crowd, you know, my crowd, we really get it because, um, you know, yes, on one hand, it can be frustrating if a doctor tries to dismiss you and say, ""It's it's in your head. It's all something well up there."" But there is that connection. But see the the um the mind uh is is connected to the immune system and if you're feeling anxious uh chronically or depressed it it it it has a negative impact on on the immune system you know and and so you can get more colds you know but you also can get you know these weird uh im immune u responses you know that can affect your joints and and and uh uh so the pain is real uh and and u and there is a connection with the mind uh uh both with uh you know muscle tension can can hurt a joint but but I think most of it is through the immune system uh- which is complicated but responds to uh mental wellbeing uh or mental distress and And uh um that that there there there's a a definite connection between uh how how we feel uh how we perceive the world uh and actually and which side is dominating and the immune system. Right. And and did you notice any difference in your physical symptoms when you did that or did you not do the visual thing for a long enough time? I didn't do it for a long time. And um right now, you know, I'm in a period where um compared to, you know, how I was feeling, I'm I'm doing pretty good. Mhm. Um although you know I should definitely probably do that for a long period of time when my muscles are starting to feel really particularly tight um due to you know long list of diagnosis I have today. But um yeah I think yeah I should definitely give that one a try. Um because I have tried to you know I try I love to experiment. I'll give anything a shot. Um so I have a you know I do know that you know my mind can associate certain things with pain and it can you know at times get worse just because my mind is bringing me there like here we go again. Well, pain is is a trauma and and u um and and that's the thing about trauma that it can begin with um uh some you know childhood rejection and then school failures and then ridicule and and and then drug abuse and and and uh uh so each trauma uh adds uh you know, to the trauma and and then it can mound up and then you can have people who really failed and and they're living on the street and using fentanyl and and uh uh and that's who we're treating in our study. And uh that everybody in our study uh with a few exceptions has had three overdoses prior to coming in. Wow. Yeah. and uh um um uh that um uh not in the study but prior to the study. So we haven't had any uh um any overdoses in the study. Uh um but um um uh and and I hope you you know we get FDA approval from this study from the FDA and then we can bring it uh to the public. Absolutely. Well, I mean the numbers you were giving me when we talked about it are phenomenal. You know, no half the you assume the half that is not getting the placebo. Yeah. their um their urge to have to to um take the drug is down 90%. Yeah. Well, it's incredible. Yeah, that's the top 10%. Uh yeah. Uh they're either 100% off or or down to 90%. And and and the bottom h uh uh 10% have gotten worse by 15%. Okay, they've increased their dose 15%. And they usually drop out. And we can tell I doesn't I wouldn't say we can tell, but we hypothesize. We can with a given person, we we we we they're not doing well and we suspect they're getting sham and somebody else is doing real well and and we suspect that they're getting the active treatment. And and it's hard for us to believe that so many people would do well with a a a sham treatment, a placebo treatment, right? Dealing with fentanyl. Absolutely. And you know, talk about this this trauma that contributes to, you know, in this case, fentanyl addiction um and the pain that comes with all of that. You know, we know, you know, we're still learning a lot, but we know that many of the people who have these kinds of addictions came from trauma to get there. These are people who Yeah, they all have come from traumatic background often come Yeah. So, it makes sense. And we don't really talk about the trauma that leads to lock them up, you know. Yeah. Exactly. Lock them up. Lock them up. Yeah. Or just say no, you know, like Yeah. Just say no. Yeah. Like Mrs. Rean used to say, ""Yes."" Yes. Um I Well, I think now this is starting to get I mean it's been what 40 I guess it's been a while, but yes, uh we used to get those commercials all the time. I remember the egg cracking, but it it is trauma. This isn't happening to groups of people who are walking into this without trauma. And the fentanyl opioid epidemic really hit places like West Virginia hard because these people are living in trauma. Right. Right. Exactly. And uh uh and we evaluate them. We have trauma scales and so forth. They all have extensive uh trauma history. So we're not giving them therapy, psychotherapy because uh it's too hard to study it. It confounds you know, there's different therapists have different abilities and right and uh but uh the the light is easy to you know if if it works it's a it's a known quantity and and it's a different comparing it to a sham is a fair comparison. So these people are getting better without psychotherapy. If you use it in in my practice with psychotherapy it's it's much more far more efficient effective. Yeah, but we know from our scales when they come in they get u uh they're given some trauma scales and and and they've all had severe trauma which I would expect and then the fentanyl uh is a huge trauma and and they feel like failure and and they can't get off this and and and compounds so that each trauma kind of adds to the old trauma. And people forget about the old trauma. They just uh they'll say, ""I'm a drug addict."" And then feel really bad about themselves. And and I like to uh say I don't have any addicts in my practice. I have trauma victims uh who you know have abused drugs uh or use them destructively and we want to attend to the trauma and and the use and interestingly uh I I can give either uh the the uh uh the the glasses uh uh or or the light treatment in my practice and um and someone can have drug cravings uh on one side and and they and not have them on the other side and just flipping the glasses and and uh uh and if I give somebody a light treatment, they can come in with uh like eight out of 10 uh cr craving uh for opioids and after their treatment uh it's way either way down. Usually it's it's it's it's off and and and that's true with alcohol too and gambling, right? Yes. Both. Yeah. And it's you know it's interesting those also things associated with trauma. Yeah. And to plug my book again, I I have um it's all about this and and and how there are uh narrative fiction descriptions of therapy sessions and talk talks about the research and and and how to help yourself with it. Yeah. And you know, I think it's it's it's phenomenal. Um you know, and I encourage everybody it is you know, you can get it tomorrow um through Amazon.com. the long title being goodbye anxiety, depression, addiction, and PTSD. I thought the top was cute. It's just all crossed out. So, my brain immediately said dual brain psychology because that's the you know that was that came across so positive and cross out all that crap I keep trying to get rid of which is difficult and um you know I just think it's very whether you're dealing with a fentanyl addiction, a family member dealing with it or something else. Everybody who is dealing with chronic illness, we we have a certain level of trauma and starting this podcast going through everything I did, it's given me a very different perspective and a set of empathy, you know, this empathy that I might not have had before because I know people get to various places because they got there through trauma. Um, you know, and you you you go through so much and you start to lose trust in medical professionals because you're still sick. And also if you're starting to feel like you can't live without certain things, so you go to the next doctor like, ""Oh, what's the next med I need? I think I feel something else again. It's all coming back."" And next thing you know, you've got 14 prescriptions. And um you know, you feel like you can't live your life without this. And I see over and over and over again in the chronic illness community where we have our own types of addictions, but we just don't put that down on paper. You're an addict. We say you're chronically ill and you have your bag os. There's even cute little funny bags out there you can order that you know your bag of drugs but you you have to really ask yourself what am I doing here? Am I dealing am I not dealing with trauma in a positive way? Yeah. And I prescribe very few drugs because I I I feel that most of them don't work and and um and and I I have to say that that this work is very effective that people get better and and uh uh and I think just even using it that with when you know from the book or blocking your eyes you know that that if you uh if you can get the concept that that that there's a person inside who's hurting and it's sort of like the inner child, but I don't like the term inner child because it's been, you know, bannered around and and trivialized. But there actually is an inner child uh in there uh who uh knows that the trauma is going to recur and and and often repeats the trauma to to have a sense of control. Yes. And um and but I I think it's really u helpful to have this concept of two minds and and uh and and rather than uh I'm suffering from trauma. Uh there's a part of me that's suffering from trauma and there's a part of me that's healthy and and I I think it's a better perspective and a more realistic perspective. Yes. because it's so easy to just see the trauma in ourselves, to see the hurt, to see the brokenness. I am a broken I've said that a million times. I feel like over the last five years, I'm a broken person. Um but there there is a healthy side to me. Yeah. You know, you just have to absolutely work towards that healthy side and understand that the broken side is there, you know, and I get better each and every day. Um so thinking of it that way, I think is so important. I still remember right after they finally diagnosed me with drug induced lupus, every new drug they put me on, you know, if I go out for a run or try to do something and everything started hurting, I'd call my doctor. It's happening again. It's a drug induced lupus. And if you Google drug induced lupus and your drug, you know, now everybody's afraid to take medication. There's a decent chance that your your medication is associated with it. But I thought every single med I took like here it is. It's happening. I know it is. I know it is. I you know, but I just could not get through the trauma of it. But obviously there was a side of me that was doing better because I was still living life. I was still picking myself up and going outside. So I like that perspective and I'm really excited to hear about the infrared study when it's completed in the FDA approval. Now we have we have a a completed study that's published uh where uh we treated Okay. So that one's already the fentanel study's already completed. No. Uh the fentanyl study um we're my site we have two sites uh okay where we're doing it uh and and at the end of this month my site will be completed and MLAN hospital is doing another site and they'll finish uh probably in October. Okay. And uh um but we have a phase one study where we uh treated 40 subjects, half of whom got sham and half active and there was a we measured um u was focused on cravings and and it was heroin not fentanyl. It was before fentanyl. Uh okay. It was in I think we finished it in 2021 and and um uh and there was a huge difference between the activives treatment and the sham treatment for craving and also for those who were using there was a gigantic difference. uh that that uh they were um uh either most had come off of of uh the heroin uh who were who got the active treatment and and uh and the sham treatment didn't. So, and that that study is published um in 2021. And I have a a website um it's um called dualbrain psychology.com and and uh and there are papers that have links to them. So, so this is a study that we published in um I I was either 2021 or 2022 and I'll have your website in the uh show notes as well so everybody can go there because it's it's fascinating work and um you know there's just so much more we have to learn about the brain and how it affects us and you know um how and very few people think about the hemispheres in other words Uh I I think I'm the only researcher who actively, you know, considers uh that the hemisphere is the most important brain area. Everybody's looking at the amygdala and the hippocampus. And there actually two amygdali. There's one in the left brain and one in the right brain. And that's true for all of these uh parts of the brain. Uh but I think when you put them all together in a hemisphere you can actually sorry about this uh you can actually put um half the brain to sleep and neurosurgeons do that as uh before surgery as a test right and u and the person can uh communicate uh when half the brain is asleep. Interesting. Yeah. Huh. That says something. Um well, you know, I love the studies. Um I'll look, you know, I'm looking forward to your next book to tell me more about that because now I want to know about that. Um it's just so fascinating and I think that for many of for many of us um you know we'll we'll keep learning more about why we um experience pain and trauma the way we do the more that we understand our minds and how to treat it. So um you know that's really fascinating um to learn about. So uh I'm excited. Um I'll be keeping a lookout for the infrared at the FDA. Hopefully it's not caught in some foregone know where where the government has gone. Yeah, it's off. We know where it's going, but but portal. We don't know what's left. Yeah. Yeah. We have no idea, but I'll keep looking for it. And if they got rid of the department, you know, maybe we can put together a proposal to see if we can't come in and take over and finish that stuff up or something. They gota they got to finish that. Somebody has to do this work. We need help. Well, well, we're going to finish the study. Um, and um, and even if we stopped at this point, we'd have enough data. Uh, but uh, but we have to get FDA approval to bring it to market. Yep. Because it's a medical device. Yeah, absolutely. Well, thank you so much for coming on. This has been a great conversation. And everybody, don't forget to order your new book, uh, Goodbye Anxiety, Depression, Addiction, and PTSD: Dualbrain Psychology, available on Amazon.com.

See you next time.","<p>Welcome to Living Chronic, the podcast that explores the realities of living with chronic illness and disability while redefining how we thrive in our personal and professional lives. I'm your host, Brandy Shance, a disabled veteran and chronic illness warrior here to discuss the challenges, triumphs, and untapped potential of life with a chronic condition. Before we dive in, please take a minute to hit the subscribe button on whatever platform you're listening. Now, let's change the way we think about disability together.
<p>Hi, this is Brandy Sh and you're listening to Living Chronic. Today, I'm here with Dr. Frederick Schiffer. He is a psychiatrist and author of the books Dual Brain and of Two Minds. So, welcome. And there's actually much longer titles there, but I'm going to make sure to put those in the notes so that I don't mess them up. Uh, but welcome to the show. I'm so happy that you're here.
<p>Thank you very much.
<p>So I'm I'm really excited you're here because since you know I guess to say everything happened to me. I have done a lot of reading um about the mind the mind body connection. So I've really enjoyed learning more about what you do which is study dual brain. Uh so if you could just tell us a little bit more about that right now.
<p>Um, let me let me uh so I have a new book out uh and and uh I'll just plug it here. It's probably coming up backwards, but it's called uh goodbye anxiety, depression, uh addiction, and PTSD, the uh lifechanging science of dual brain psychology. And it's on Amazon. So um uh so uh and the the available next day delivery, too. Yeah. Okay. And my other book is is as as you pointed out, it's called of Two Minds. That's an earlier book. And and uh so um there we go. Okay. I just wanted to straighten that out. Uh so um uh where would you like me to start?
<p>Uh well, you know, some of the things that um were so fascinating to me was talking about, you know, that dual brain and treating um the immature, troubled half of the brain. I know you and I talked about doing a couple little tests. Um but, you200e know, as somebody who who I myself suffer from PTSD, um you know, reading about this particular type of treatment is fascinating. I know, um there's a lot of different ideas out there of ways you could treat PTSD. um cognit cognitive behavioral therapy I think seems to be the one that I hear about the most and of course I've also heard a lot about micro doing um LSD things like that but this you know really seemed very tangible to me probably because I keep reading more about the mindbody connection over the years uh so it just felt very tangible and like something you could really reach out and understand um whereas I think many of us who are not in the medical field hear about some of these these things and think h does that really does that really work what what does that mean but this did feel very tangible to me so why why don't I explain first u uh what my hypothesis is and maybe how I arrived at it and and what the uh treatment uh component of it is
<p>um so uh uh I'm a psychiatrist I was trained at Harvard at MLAN hospital and I've stayed there for decades and I'm still there. Um uh and um so I've done about 30 plus years of research with multiple publications and and uh and and and um um and a few books on on on this. Um and the idea is uh my my theory is called dual brain uh psychology and and and it's that I've learned over the years that uh each brain hemisphere can support a separate mind. Now they both have the same social security number and the same address uh and they go by the same name. But if you stimulate and it's easy to stimulate one brain hemisphere or the other, you get a different personality and and um um uh that uh so the the hypothesis based on years of research and and uh and research that has uh supported it with with a lot of imaging studies and clinical trials and serious research. That's unusual for a psychological theory.
<p>And um uh the uh so the idea is that trauma is the cause of all of the psychiatric problems that I've encountered. Now it may not be true of the whole world, but it's true of my world. and and that usually people don't realize uh how uh the trauma especially early trauma uh um uh affects them and and it gets stuck in one brain hemisphere and so the result is that uh on one side there's an immature traumatized person and on the other side uh you're the same person but the personality is very different and I'll look different out one side or the other and um and it's it's very easy to stimulate uh one hemisphere or the other with a visual technique and I also use photobiomodulation which we could talk about later but the visual technique is very simple and I'll use my book to demonstrate it. You cover one eye and the middle of the other eye. So, I'm looking out the uh lateral half of of my right eye. And uh so that's my uh uh right lateral visual field. And um and when I first did it, I just used my hands went like this. and and uh uh and I asked uh my first patient to try that and he was a Vietnam veteran who uh had several tours of duty and and had PTSD was doing quite well. But when I asked him to do that, he got very upset and he said, ""That plant behind you looks like the jungle."" And I I said, ""Oh, well, but look out the other side."" And um and he smiled. He said, ""No, it's a nice looking plant.""
<p>And uh and so in my practice uh uh when people look out one lateral visual field or the other uh um I can look different. I can look supportive on one side and and critical on the other side like maybe their parent was or someone. And uh and so the focus of dualbrain psychology or is uh to treat the troubled side and and u that usually uh when the patient comes in the two sides are fighting or the the troubled side dominates and doesn't give the health they don't even know they have a healthy side and and uh uh and so the the therapy is to try to talk with the troubled side as in a typical therapy, you know, what are you feeling and what's that remind you of and and and and where we go is to the trauma and and then I try and list the the healthy side uh to be sort of a co-therapist and also is very instructive to the uh patient to be able to with a simple technique feel better and feel no I can handle it and and it reduces their anxiety and their depression uh and um uh so just looking at one side in itself uh is isn't a a a cure uh but it's an aid and and and uh oftentimes if someone's upset about something they can grab an envelope or their hands and and look out that one side and actually make a big change in in their outlook and their feelings and and that's very helpful uh to to to my patients and and and uh to have someone in in your head who can feel good uh is surprising and unexpected and and uh uh and and can show uh the troubled side that there's
<p>Oh, and and uh yeah, I thought it was very interesting to to read about um um particularly, you know, again associated with that anxiety because I've been, you know, I I've everybody who listens to my show is very aware of the trauma I experienced in um my medical health. Um I definitely suffered a lot of medical trauma. I also suffer from PTSD from my time during um serving in the army and I have tried various things and I've often said that sometimes I feel like the anxiety is not there. I'm fine and then other days very small things trigger it and I cannot get past it. So learning a bit about dual brain made me think, well, you know, maybe there is maybe I know how to use that other side of my brain and it's just I don't know how to get past the trigger over there. So when you have a patient who who you're going through this with, you know, how do you kind of take that next step to figuring out how to overcome that traumatized side of the brain?
<p>Um, uh, okay. I I see the the the two sides as sort of like there was a Steve Martin movie in in the I think it was in the 1980s called The Two of Us. And Lily Tomlin uh uh was with her was meditating with her guru and there was a terrible accident. the the hummingb slipped out of the guru's hands and tumbled down a flight of stairs in in Manhattan. And as a result of this accident, Lily Tomlin's mind got embedded in Steve Martin's brain. And and so you so Steve Martin is the embodiment and and and you see him going like this where where Lily Tomlin wants to go downtown and he wants to go uptown in Manhattan and and uh and she's screaming at him and and he's telling her to shut up and and and this is really what happens in in real people. In other words, the two sides can fight for dominance sometimes. one as I said one one side and usually if you know someone's coming for help they're symptomatic so usually it's a troubled side that's dominating and uh so uh what one of the interesting things is just like uh real people that if someone said to Lily Tomlin don't take that from him you know go on downtown you know it would embolden her and and and if uh Uh if if Steve Martin said, ""Now calm down now. Uh you know, we we need to work together and and uh uh and you know, stop yelling at me."" And and uh uh that um uh you can actually affect uh the hemisphere by talking to it. And I talked to uh each person and and uh and I I actually have uh sunglasses that that were uh uh and that these uh stimulate uh one one hemisphere or the other. If you put them on, they look like normal sunglasses. Uh uh but they actually stimulate one side or the other. And uh so I'll I'll ask the patient to wear them to bring out the uh the troubled side and and talk to it and and um and say, ""Wow, that must have really been difficult."" and and uh uh and uh then we'll flip it to the other side now. Then I'll talk to the healthier side and say that side's really frightened and and you you really need to understand it and and not be angry about it and and uh that it it's not, you know, it's it's misguided and and and needs needs your help. Um and um so um so how to bring out the healthy side is to be aware that there is a healthy side and and if if it works for you uh use the lateral vision. Uh so um that's um um excuse me that that actually is very powerful and and these glasses are powerful. Uh and uh and I also have an LED that I put on the forehead. It's called photobiomodulation. And uh uh I'm going to set this here so it stops rocking. Okay. Sorry.
<p>Um so um uh uh with the photobiomodulation we're doing a study for fentanyl addiction. It's a it's a a large uh NIH study for the FDA and and we're getting uh we think we're getting great results because many of the fentanyl addicts are uh doing well uh both with their dose and and and and they're feeling well and and doing well. Half of the patients get a sham treatment and half get an active treatment. And it's just a four-minute light treatment. There there aren't any uh uh side effects so far. And and I've been doing it actually for 15 years. And and uh and other people are doing it. It's a it's a burgeoning field now. It's called photobiomodulation. But I'm the only person who puts the light over the positive hemisphere. Okay. Once you use the the eye test, I determine which is the positive side. And the light is two or three times more powerful than the um glasses. But the the uh or the eye u maneuver, but the eye maneuver is easier to do. You know, you just put your hands up or put put sunglasses on. And uh so in my practice uh usually by the end of the session I give the person a light treatment and and have a a study go going on right now for depression and getting great results.
<p>Yeah. I thought I thought the infrared was very interesting because I I'm familiar with it. You know I I know in infrared sauna. I love an infrared sauna. Right. I've used infrared and other you know I know there's a lot of other ladies out there. We're trying to battle wrinkles. I've got my little infrared light I put on my face to, you know, make me look a little less old. Um, so this idea that it could also help um with my anxiety, with my PTSD, with my depression is pretty fascinating. And I wonder how much, you know, using it on a daily basis, you know, would be able to help just in overall health.
<p>Yeah, I actually use it um u almost every day, you know, and I don't have time. I don't but uh yeah, I would say that I I use it about five times a week and and I use it for cognitive enhancement. U so I'm not except when I'm choking now. Um uh uh I'm I'm not uh and I'm not really anxious now, but um um uh so I'm not really very symptomatic, but I I feel that it it gives me a a little cognitive edge, right? And um uh now, but you have to use it on on one side. So, so if you're using the sauna, you're you're you're radiating both sides and that might give some benefit, but you you're also stimulating the troubled side, right? Uh and also your trauma uh was later. In other words, it it the major trauma occurred as an adult and most and so I don't know if it's as lateralized. Most of the people I see uh have dysfunctional families and uh maybe an alcoholic father or a demeaning mother and or a bullying brother. These are the kinds of traumas that I typically see and and they're childhood traumas and they and they seem to get lodged on one side. Did you have a an effect when you tried it looking laterally or or you know
<p>I did I kept trying it a few times after we first discussed it and I and I did I tried thinking of a few different things. Um I think I felt a lot when I thought about uh my time in Afghanistan actually. Of course that's been I mean it's 20 you know 20 years on at this point but it doesn't go away but um but it did you know do something. So, uh, I, you know, it certainly made sense to me, you know, I definitely felt, so I was thinking about the time, my time in Afghanistan, like we discussed and I was looking at um, a photo of me and my husband and, you know, we served in the army together, right? And when I covered one side um, you know, everything felt, you know, scary and I started getting really anxious. Um and then the other side and I felt very happy looking at the photo of us. So it was it was stark. It was stark.
<p>Okay, that's cool. Okay, so that's a good response. Okay. Uh and um so I always take a risk if I bring it up because I say if someone doesn't respond it sounds, you know, like it's it's a failure. But so you you had a a good response and that's and you can use that. Uh so as you said, you know, if you want to pull up your mature side, you look out that side and and then if you want to talk to the traumatized side, you can uh you know uh look out the the uh the side that stimulates the negative hemisphere. And also I I want to say that we we have a study that we published from MLAN hospital at Harvard uh showing that uh just looking out one lateral visual field or the other. We had people go into an fMRI scanner with goggles that had tape on it and if you looked out one side um it it it covered one eye and you only could see out half the other eye. And then so if you look to the left uh you activated your right visual field and it lit up like a Christmas tree and not the other side was dark. Now, now uh it's not that only one side was working, but we were able to manipulate the data to exaggerate the difference between the sides and and and when we did that, which we were allowed to do because we had a hypothesis. Um uh it it was really a a f fantastic result. And when the patient looked uh to the opposite side, uh the hemisphere switched and and the other side lit up and the other and the uh same the uh same side um uh I don't want to use like ipsolateral side, right? Uh uh was was dark. it's just flipped and and um uh so it's it's a real effect just uh doing this simple maneuver of just you know covering one eye and half the other eye and and if you look out the whole cover one eye and look out one eye it's not going to work because there you're you're stimulating both hemispheres right and and that's why you have to cover uh half of u one eye and look out the lateral portion and um um uh and you know and if you're uh feeling uh distress and it might even help with physical symptoms. I a lot of times uh I'll give someone a light treatment and they'll say my chest pain went away. I didn't even know they were having chest pain. And uh and and one time uh uh and this never happened again, but it was a couple years ago. I had three people in one day who said my hip pain went away and I had them walk downstairs and walk up again and they said, ""No, it feels good."" You know, and uh now it didn't last and it wasn't a a cure. Uh but it was it was interesting, you know. So it it it can affect the the body because the mind is connected to the body.
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I think so many especially my listeners you know so many of us have chronic illness you know we've read all the John Earno books Dr. especially, you know, and for good and bad reasons. We have many different, you know, feelings associated with this because sometimes you go to a doctor and they say, ""Well, it's all in your head."" And, you know, no, it's not, doc. I have something very real. I mean, it took me four years to get my diagnosis and turns out it's not in my head at all. Um, but that being said, uh, many of us have been able to use, um, therapy or, um, you know, other means to try to help along with our pain. And I've learned from my own experiences and, you know, reading about this and trying every, you know, I've, you know, basically been at a point where I'll try anything if it might make me feel better. But the the the mind, as much as I want to say that I have this strong, you know, aversion to pain, I can get through anything. I'm chronically ill, um I actually have a very weak tolerance. Um because my mind associates anything with pain at this point. Um everything that has happened to me over the last five years. You know, some I was starting to associate running with pain because every time I tried to run, my joints and muscles seized up and I couldn't move. Uh so I've started to learn that sometimes even though it may not you know the source of my pain was not just in my head but my head associates so many things and I've been able to identify just an absurd list at this point of things that I've gone through that my mind now associates with pain and I sort of recoil like oh gosh this is going to hurt and I suddenly have a very low tolerance for pain as a result. So, um, you know, I think this this crowd, you know, my crowd, we really get it because, um, you know, yes, on one hand, it can be frustrating if a doctor tries to dismiss you and say, ""It's it's in your head. It's all something well up there."" But there is that connection.
<p>But see the the um the mind uh is is connected to the immune system and if you're feeling anxious uh chronically or depressed it it it it has a negative impact on on the immune system you know and and so you can get more colds you know but you also can get you know these weird uh im immune u responses you know that can affect your joints and and and uh uh so the pain is real uh and and u and there is a connection with the mind uh uh both with uh you know muscle tension can can hurt a joint but but I think most of it is through the immune system uh- which is complicated but responds to uh mental wellbeing uh or mental distress and And uh um that that there there there's a a definite connection between uh how how we feel uh how we perceive the world uh and actually and which side is dominating and the immune system. Right.
<p>And and did you notice any difference in your physical symptoms when you did that or did you not do the visual thing for a long enough time?
<p>I didn't do it for a long time. And um right now, you know, I'm in a period where um compared to, you know, how I was feeling, I'm I'm doing pretty good. Mhm. Um although you know I should definitely probably do that for a long period of time when my muscles are starting to feel really particularly tight um due to you know long list of diagnosis I have today. But um yeah I think yeah I should definitely give that one a try. Um because I have tried to you know I try I love to experiment. I'll give anything a shot. Um so I have a you know I do know that you know my mind can associate certain things with pain and it can you know at times get worse just because my mind is bringing me there like here we go again.
<p>Well, pain is is a trauma and and u um and and that's the thing about trauma that it can begin with um uh some you know childhood rejection and then school failures and then ridicule and and and then drug abuse and and and uh uh so each trauma uh adds uh you know, to the trauma and and then it can mound up and then you can have people who really failed and and they're living on the street and using fentanyl and and uh uh and that's who we're treating in our study. And uh that everybody in our study uh with a few exceptions has had three overdoses prior to coming in. Wow. Yeah. and uh um um uh that um uh not in the study but prior to the study. So we haven't had any uh um any overdoses in the study. uh um but um um uh and and I hope you you know we get FDA approval from this study from the FDA and then we can bring it uh to the public.
<p>Absolutely. Well, I mean the numbers you were giving me when we talked about it are phenomenal. You know, no half the you assume the half that is not getting the placebo. Yeah. their um their urge to have to to um take the drug is down 90%. Yeah. Well, it's incredible. Yeah, that's the top 10%. Uh yeah. Uh they're either 100% off or or down to 90%. And and and the bottom h uh uh 10% have gotten worse by 15%. Okay, they've increased their dose 15%. And they usually drop out. And we can tell I doesn't I wouldn't say we can tell, but we hypothesize. We can with a given person, we we we we they're not doing well and we suspect they're getting sham and somebody else is doing real well and and we suspect that they're getting the active treatment. And and it's hard for us to believe that so many people would do well with a a a sham treatment, a placebo treatment, right? Dealing with fentanyl. Absolutely.
<p>And you know, talk about this this trauma that contributes to, you know, in this case, fentanyl addiction um and the pain that comes with all of that. You know, we know, you know, we're still learning a lot, but we know that many of the people who have these kinds of addictions came from trauma to get there. These are people who Yeah, they all have come from traumatic background often come Yeah. So, it makes sense. And we don't really talk about the trauma that leads to lock them up, you know. Yeah. Exactly. Lock them up. Lock them up. Yeah. Or just say no, you know, like Yeah. Just say no. Yeah. Like Mrs. Rean used to say, ""Yes."" Yes. Um I Well, I think now this is starting to get I mean it's been what 40 I guess it's been a while, but yes, uh we used to get those commercials all the time. I remember the egg cracking, but it it is trauma. This isn't happening to groups of people who are walking into this without trauma. And the fentanyl opioid epidemic really hit places like West Virginia hard because these people are living in trauma. Right. Right. Exactly. And uh uh and we evaluate them. We have trauma scales and so forth. They all have extensive uh trauma history. So we're not giving them therapy, psychotherapy because uh it's too hard to study it. It confounds you know, there's different therapists have different abilities and right and uh but uh the the light is easy to you know if if it works it's a it's a known quantity and and it's a different comparing it to a sham is a fair comparison. So these people are getting better without psychotherapy. If you use it in in my practice with psychotherapy it's it's much more far more efficient effective. Yeah, but we know from our scales when they come in they get u uh they're given some trauma scales and and and and they've all had severe trauma which I would expect and then the fentanyl uh is a huge trauma and and they feel like failure and and they can't get off this and and and compounds so that each trauma kind of adds to the old trauma. And people forget about the old trauma. They just uh they'll say, ""I'm a drug addict."" And then feel really bad about themselves. And and I like to uh say I don't have any addicts in my practice. I have trauma victims uh who you know have abused drugs uh or use them destructively and we want to attend to the trauma and and the use and interestingly uh I I can give either uh the the uh uh the the glasses uh uh or or the light treatment in my practice and um and someone can have drug cravings uh on one side and and they and not have them on the other side and just flipping the glasses and and uh uh and if I give somebody a light treatment, they can come in with uh like eight out of 10 uh cr craving uh for opioids and after their treatment uh it's way either way down. Usually it's it's it's it's off and and and that's true with alcohol too and gambling, right? Yes. Both. Yeah.
<p>And it's you know it's interesting those also things associated with trauma. Yeah.
<p>And to plug my book again, I I have um it's all about this and and and how there are uh narrative fiction descriptions of therapy sessions and talk talks about the research and and and how to help yourself with it. Yeah.
<p>And you know, I think it's it's it's phenomenal. Um you know, and I encourage everybody it is you know, you can get it tomorrow um through Amazon.com. the long title being goodbye anxiety, depression, addiction, and PTSD. I thought the top was cute. It's just all crossed out. So, my brain immediately said dual brain psychology because that's the you know that was that came across so positive and cross out all that crap I keep trying to get rid of which is difficult and um you know I just think it's very whether you're dealing with a fentanyl addiction, a family member dealing with it or something else. Everybody who is dealing with chronic illness, we we have a certain level of trauma and starting this podcast going through everything I did, it's given me a very different perspective and a set of empathy, you know, this empathy that I might not have had before because I know people get to various places because they got there through trauma. Um, you know, and you you you go through so much and you start to lose trust in medical professionals because you're still sick. And also if you're starting to feel like you can't live without certain things, so you go to the next doctor like, ""Oh, what's the next med I need? I think I feel something else again. It's all coming back."" And next thing you know, you've got 14 prescriptions. And um you know, you feel like you can't live your life without this. And I see over and over and over again in the chronic illness community where we have our own types of addictions, but we just don't put that down on paper. You're an addict. We say you're chronically ill and you have your bag os. There's even cute little funny bags out there you can order that you know your bag of drugs but you you have to really ask yourself what am I doing here? Am I dealing am I not dealing with trauma in a positive way?
<p>Yeah. And I prescribe very few drugs because I I I feel that most of them don't work and and um and and I I have to say that that this work is very effective that people get better and and uh uh and I think just even using it that with when you know from the book or blocking your eyes you know that that if you uh if you can get the concept that that that there's a person inside who's hurting and it's sort of like the inner child, but I don't like the term inner child because it's been, you know, bannered around and and trivialized. But there actually is an inner child uh in there uh who uh knows that the trauma is going to recur and and and often repeats the trauma to to have a sense of control. Yes. And um and but I I think it's really u helpful to have this concept of two minds and and uh and and rather than uh I'm suffering from trauma. Uh there's a part of me that's suffering from trauma and there's a part of me that's healthy and and I I think it's a better perspective and a more realistic perspective.
<p>Yes. because it's so easy to just see the trauma in ourselves, to see the hurt, to see the brokenness. I am a broken I've said that a million times. I feel like over the last five years, I'm a broken person. Um but there there is a healthy side to me. Yeah. You know, you just have to absolutely work towards that healthy side and understand that the broken side is there, you know, and I get better each and every day. Um so thinking of it that way, I think is so important. I still remember right after they finally diagnosed me with drug induced lupus, every new drug they put me on, you know, if I go out for a run or try to do something and everything started hurting, I'd call my doctor. It's happening again. It's a drug induced lupus. And if you Google drug induced lupus and your drug, you know, now everybody's afraid to take medication. There's a decent chance that your your medication is associated with it. But I thought every single med I took like here it is. It's happening. I know it is. I know it is. I you know, but I just could not get through the trauma of it. But obviously there was a side of me that was doing better because I was still living life. I was still picking myself up and going outside. So I like that perspective and I'm really excited to hear about the infrared study when it's completed in the FDA approval.
<p>Now we have we have a a completed study that's published uh where uh we treated Okay. So that one's already the fentanel study's already completed.
<p>No. Uh the fentanyl study um we're my site we have two sites uh Okay. where we're doing it uh and and at the end of this month my site will be completed and MLAN hospital is doing another site and they'll finish uh probably in October. Okay. And uh um but we have a phase one study where we uh treated 40 subjects, half of whom got sham and half active and there was a we measured um u was focused on cravings and and it was heroin not fentanyl. It was before fentanyl. Uh okay. It was in I think we finished it in 2021 and and um uh and there was a huge difference between the activives treatment and the sham treatment for craving and also for those who were using there was a gigantic difference. uh that that uh they were um uh either most had come off of of uh the heroin uh who were who got the active treatment and and uh and the sham treatment didn't. So, and that that study is published um in 2021. And I have a a website um it's um called dualbrain psychology.com and and uh and there are papers that have links to them.
<p>and I'll have your website in the uh show notes as well so everybody can go there because it's it's fascinating work and um you know there's just so much more we have to learn about the brain and how it affects us and you know um how and very few people think about the hemispheres in other words Uh I I think I'm the only researcher who actively, you know, considers uh that the hemisphere is the most important brain area. Everybody's looking at the amygdala and the hippocampus. And there actually two amygdali. There's one in the left brain and one in the right brain. And that's true for all of these uh parts of the brain. Uh but I think when you put them all together in a hemisphere you can actually sorry about this uh you can actually put um half the brain to sleep and neurosurgeons do that as uh before surgery as a test right and u and the person can uh communicate uh when half the brain is asleep.
<p>Interesting. Yeah. Huh. That says something.
<p>Um well, you know, I love the studies. Um I'll look, you know, I'm looking forward to your next book to tell me more about that because now I want to know about that. Um it's just so fascinating and I think that for many of for many of us um you know we'll we'll keep learning more about why we um experience pain and trauma the way we do the more that we understand our minds and how to treat it. So um you know that's really fascinating um to learn about. So uh I'm excited. Um I'll be keeping a lookout for the infrared at the FDA. Hopefully it's not caught in some foregone know where where the government has gone. Yeah, it's off. We know where it's going, but but portal. We don't know what's left. Yeah. Yeah. We have no idea, but I'll keep looking for it. And if they got rid of the department, you know, maybe we can put together a proposal to see if we can't come in and take over and finish that stuff up or something. They gota they got to finish that. Somebody has to do this work. We need help.
<p>Well, well, we're going to finish the study. Um, and um, and even if we stopped at this point, we'd have enough data. Uh, but uh, but we have to get FDA approval to bring it to market. Yep. Because it's a medical device. Yeah, absolutely.
<p>Well, thank you so much for coming on. This has been a great conversation. And everybody, don't forget to order your new book, uh, Goodbye Anxiety, Depression, Addiction, and PTSD: Dualbrain Psychology, available on Amazon.com.

Dual Brain Psychology and Photobiomodulation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVYFFIvdOP8,hey welcome back to the laser therapy institute podcast my name is dr jason rountree i'll be your host again today but i'm joined by a very special guest we have dr fred schiffer here with us he attended drexel university school of medicine where he earned his md and that was followed by residencies in internal medicine and psychiatry as well as a cardiology fellowship he is a board certified physician and psychiatrist he is a research associate at mclean hospital he's an assistant professor of psychiatry part-time at harvard medical school and he was a speaker at the 2021 photobiomodulation summit he's also a published author and he currently sees patients at his office in newton highlands massachusetts as well as via telehealth dr schiffer welcome to the podcast hi pleasure to be here i'm very excited to have you here we have some really interesting things to cover today a couple of neat concepts a couple of things that are being done with photobiomodulation or light therapy that really is stunning so first though let's let's kind of start back in the beginning if you don't mind tell me about your interest in medicine where did you get started with this whole thing uh okay i think you mean my interest in uh photobiomodulation well yes i'm very interested to know how you got involved in photobiomodulation or are you interested in how i got into medicine and psychiatry here i would love to hear a little on you need like your initial interest in medicine sure in medical school i had no thought of going into psychiatry i was i did an internship in internal medicine and residency and internal medicine and then did a fellowship in cardiology at harvard and and um and that fellowship was a research fellowship on stress and and uh heart disease and um and then to complete my education uh i did a residency uh in psychiatry uh at mclean and uh i was thinking of becoming sort of a psycho cardiologist and uh and what i found was that uh no one was interested in that but the cardiologist gave lip service to stress and stuff they didn't really want to go deeply into it and and it turned out that it it was there was a lot to in that field i i did a rotation at mass general and i was in working in the icu and everybody who came in with a heart attack had a very interesting psychological story and um uh uh one guy uh just notice for the cardiologist he just had a heart attack and came in but when i spoke to him uh his father died when he was uh 10 years old and his mother would wring her hands and say oh what are we going to do what are we going to do and he would say don't worry i'll take care of it and he did that all his life and and so the night of the heart attack he was out to dinner with his business partner and they had some problems and and business partners said well you know i'm going to take a vacation and uh and and his usual response was well don't worry i'll take care of it but uh this time he couldn't and had a heart attack and and and he could relate to that and and uh so there really was a lot to that uh field but but it i wasn't able to uh promote it uh and so i became a a standard psychiatrist and and i love psychiatry and and uh um um and uh but i i was always interested in kind of thinking about things and not not just learning road techniques and and uh so at that time uh freud was uh uh the the and freudian psychiatry was uh uh in in vogue and and and you you didn't see a psychopharmacologist they were kind of weird people on the periphery and uh uh so this was uh uh 1975 i started my residency at mclean and it was a three-year residency and um and then i stayed on at mclean as an attending psychiatrist which essentially meant i had a private practice at mclean and then i had an outside private practice and and and i was noticing that my patients didn't seem uh to have um uh the uh is in egos uh that we talked about they're the superego in other words when i saw a patient it wasn't like like i understood what the id was and what the ego was and uh but it wasn't what i was really seeing uh was uh that the patient was in one personality when he was regressed and then as he got better he was like a different person and it was a whole different personality and and and that's what really struck me and and i tried to promote that idea uh about two minds and and um and it didn't go anywhere uh and um uh it's very hard to promote a new idea and uh and then uh in 1990 uh i was on vacation with my family in england in the english countryside and i was reading a book uh about the split brain studies and i had you know studied it in college but i didn't really understand what it meant so uh the these uh studies um uh were done for people with uh terrible epilepsy that their lives were they completely disrupted by constant seizures and so there was a drastic uh treatment uh which was to cut the connection between the two halves of the brain so the brain is sort of like a walnut has two wrinkled halves which is the left and right brain and there's a stem between the two and the stems with the corpus callosum and uh so the the foot brain operation uh was uh i'm gonna turn off my uh uh mail oh sure okay um so the footprint operations were uh done by dr joseph bogan and uh and they were dr roger sperry who won the nobel prize for the these studies was at cal tech and he was the physiologist uh in the studies and and uh they went on for about 10 years and and so the the important finding there are like a lot of weird stories about a woman is buttoning her dress to put it on and unbuttoning your dress with her other hand and and it was hard to kind of make sense of what this really meant but as i reread it uh what i saw was that each hemisphere of the brain in his foot brain patients had a mind of his own uh that that when you cut the the corpus callosum you actually had two intelligent people uh and uh and they both understood english and could do commands uh very easily and had a sense of humor and um uh the the difference was that the left brain could talk speeches as we know uh in in most people is in the left uh hemisphere and and uh so the right isolated right hemisphere was mute but he could talk with hand signals uh it could point to uh uh scrabble chips uh in in actually in one patient he he could spell uh words and and uh uh he's he's his left brain speaking said that he wanted to become a draftsman and uh pointing to scrambled chips he wrote a racecar driver uh had you had to say to uh you see uh different personalities or different intentions uh right but they're both intelligent so they both understood the this sort of complex question but what do you want to be when you grow up he was a teenager and so if you showed a picture the uh the eyes are connected to the brain in an interesting way and i have a diagram of it if you want to see that that'd be great okay [Music] so the way the eyes are connected to the hemisphere so here's the split brain patient the connections is uh cut here and if you show an image to the left side it it goes uh through the lens and hits the medial retina and crosses over uh and stimulates the uh goes first to the back of the brain but actually stimulates the uh the brain in that uh the person uh the the right brain only can see the picture uh if you ask the the person who can speak in his left brain he says i can't see it and then if you have a box here with 10 items in it uh with his uh uh left hand which is controlled by his right brain he can easily reach into the box and and pull out the chest piece the uh right arm and right hand is connected to the left brain and if you put the same box on the other side the uh right hand has no idea what to pick because as the person told you you didn't see it uh and if you put the item over here uh the right brain can't see it and the left brain will say uh oh it's a chest piece it's a um it looks like a uh uh i think it's a queen you might be a king huh um yeah okay and um [Music] so uh uh what i found the that the most important aspect of the slow brain studies was that you had an intelligent person in the right brain uh who could answer questions and uh actually these are uh this is roger sperry uh over here this is joe bogan and this is iran zeidel who who actually died a few months ago uh and i went out and did a study with uh bogan and zydell as uh sperry had died by that time and um um and so this these are studies that uh sperry did where they'd put a word on one side of the um so both sides could read and uh so one side of the screen tooth goes only to the uh right brain and brush goes only to the uh left brain and uh and so he the person will say brush because he can speak and then he can reach over and pick out the tooth so i did a variation of that i did the first study uh which was a psychological interview of the two hemispheres and so uh on each side of the screen are different words uh each uh hemisphere sees uh the they they each see 35 words and and they're pairs so here it's a admired or disrespected ashamed admired attracted dishonest and uh uh uh trying to uh have positive and negative words and then the uh person would point with his uh hand to uh there were five pegs um and uh and and his response would be uh non-mild moderate predator extreme and we got very um consistent responses and and what we found was in in one patient uh his right hemisphere was happier and and and so the positive responses were higher in the uh right brain than in the left brain and the negative responses were lower and and this was statistically significant the other patient uh had been bullied as a child and he told me that it didn't bother him it happened so long ago uh but uh when i asked the the questions uh his uh left-hand uh signing for his right mute right brain said that he was extremely upset by the bullies and and i put in a bunch of bully questions i kind of made up and um so yeah this was with a split brain patient yeah correct okay okay yeah okay uh but it gave me the idea that maybe um uh uh what uh what i was um uh seeing uh where i was seeing two different personalities in my patients rather than a need and an ego which which exists and which i understand um uh maybe there was some connection between the footbrain studies and and so um uh uh uh let's just give a little so uh werner whitling was a german uh uh scientist and uh he developed a very complex device to show movies in normal people to one hemisphere or the other and it was very difficult to follow what his protocol was he was tracking eye movements and masking a computer screen and and i had to read it several times to understand what he was doing and and and then i i figured out what he was doing and and he was just showing the movie to the lateral visual field so he was really doing the same thing that's very did uh putting the the picture to one side and so i came up with uh my own version which i could afford a lot more direct you just cover that opposite visual field then okay right right so so and then i had the goggles uh made uh and and then they i think sort of hurt me because they look sort of goofy but they were very effective in um and what what we found was that uh if a person looked out one side and i didn't and it could be left or right and varied within people uh their personality would be very different and they would say that i looked very critical on one side and they didn't like themselves and they might have drug cravings and then i'd have them look out the other side and i looked better and they liked themselves more and their cravings went away and uh and it happened immediately it was a so the first time i tried it i just i i tried it myself and didn't respond uh i i did respond uh about five years later uh uh in an interesting uh uh way um but my first um trial with this uh i had a um my first patient that day was a vietnam vet and um uh and he had severe ptsd had a purple heart and i'd had uh three or four tours of duty and and his face screwed up uh when i asked him to look out uh at one side and uh uh and i i think it was his uh uh uh right visual field so it would be his left brain and and he said that plant behind you looks like the jungle and i said really uh and i said look out the other side and he smiles he says no it's a nice looking plant and i i knew that i had something and and and the rest of my when i do this with patients all the time now i i get um about 55 of people have these really strong responses and and about another 30 percent will have a uh positive response but it might like their anxiety level might be like a one or two point difference uh between sides uh this guy would would go from like an eight to a two wow and uh um so uh the hypothesis is so what i call this is dual brain psychology and and then uh just started at dual brain institute to teach i have seminars to teach clinicians how to do this because it's it's tricky in how to learn it and how to put it into your practice but it's very useful in in psychotherapy uh to have a person who feels really depressed and they don't see any future and they look out the other side and they they feel better and then there's hope and and um so one question would be you know is it always the left side is it always the right side no that's a very important point that i thought uh and i wrote some papers on it that i'd like to retract i never did uh and they're they're well sighted um uh they decided all the time and that is that i thought all the i wrote papers thinking that the right brain was like the unconscious or the negative hemisphere and that's sort of the popular notion but what i found is it's about half and half and that a lot of times ptsd is more in the left brain uh but but i think uh it's it's impossible to know uh it's possible for me to know unless i test somebody which side is uh more positive but but everybody who responds has the same response it's that one side feels good i look good and the other side uh i i look critical and and and their personality changes their physical uh appearance changes uh in in people who have intense responses and and they're they'll often say to me you know my chest pain went away i didn't know they're having chest pain i i've i've had uh patients uh uh have i just generally feel better and and their pain often decreases uh it's it's uh often i i had some examples uh uh uh kind of amazing so i did a a a study um um so here's a this is kind of the theory so here there's a healthy side and a uh here's a real mean looking guy there actually this is an interesting um i let me let me before i get this is a maybe i might come back to this if we have time this is a transcript from a patient who had a strong response and you see the psychology but it's not just that he feels good uh it it involves his the problems that he had he i treated him for cocaine addiction he did well and i had him come back and um oh i'll read a little bit of it here uh uh and so i asked him uh how he feels i don't know which side he's looking looking at uh uh and i'm getting away from your question so i so i don't know which side in a given patient and we use that uh to study uh uh rtms and i'll show you that and that's how i got to uh photobiomodulation okay so it's coming up here but but i'll just say read this uh quickly uh uh i asked him how he feels anxious because i can't see what might be coming at me from the other side just a new feeling or familiar feeling i'd say sort of a familiar because i'm in business and you never know what's about to happen definitely unknown now it's interesting he doesn't connect with his psychology it's just you know he feels [Music] uh would better try on the other goggles uh so i had two pairs of goggles and uh uh how much anxiety are you feeling looking out the left side so this is his right brain uh i think glass mild can you describe the difference between how you feel on one side versus the other i'm more relaxed on this side on the other side i'm more uptight let's put the other pair back on how do you feel same as before not as comfortable i'm just thinking about things that i did in the past and everything about me then i really didn't think about anybody but myself and the abuse and some of those things i've been through in life it's not what i want to remember not good can i take them off wow it's really you know intense but uh i just want to ask one more question and say i okay can you relate these uncomfortable feelings to your father i see i treated him for two years and so i knew this you know that his father was important uh to his uh addiction uh i don't know i was never comfortable around my father with these glasses on it's sort of like dealing with him again because it's always the unknown always a pressure and a problem yeah you feel the unknown you have the tension and then he talked about the unknown in business but it really ties back to the unknown with his father we didn't know when his father was going to criticize him uh and uh so and i asked him later on it what would it take him to use drugs and he says he was looking at the good side i would never do that and i said how about the other side and said you know i think i could see myself doing it on the other side um wow so this is a my book here um and and joseph bogan wrote on the uh cover uh wonderfully readable well-informed this is the best book ever on the social and psychiatric implications of this foot brain research and and candace perk who discovered the opiate receptor said the schiffer rivals freud in his revolutionary theories on understating the human psyche now i learned later that she was talking about ludwig freud who was sigmund's uh brother who was a baker i'm sure not uh so uh so this is the second edition which uh uh has a a preface that brings up the uh this first came out in 1998 and has a lot of transcripts like the one i read to you and then there's been a a whole bunch of research that we've published at mclean uh since the book came out so that's it included in the uh second edition when when did the second edition come out in august of this year brand new awesome yeah yeah okay um uh so i i took my goggles down to alvaro pasqualione who at that time uh was a well-known researcher he still is and uh but he at that time he was uh a pioneer in uh uh uh transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a treatment for depression and uh and uh for for reasons that aren't clear to me uh they always stimulate the left side and uh so i predicted that if your left side was your negative side you wouldn't do well and if it was your positive side you would and uh and so he took the glasses and then i had trouble getting him to answer my emails or calls and so finally i i actually had to go to his office and and and and so over here is the data from a paper that we published and and this uh column here are the people who felt worse in their left brain so when they look to the right they have more depression and then they look to the left that's what that means and this is right visual field versus left visual field that's very positive okay yeah so down to the bottom it says that so so that the the um uh it's how depressed are you so if you're more depressed uh uh in the uh right visual field um well i know that this is the the negative uh this is uh the left negative um um i'm getting confused when i uh uh look at the label here but i'm not gonna uh belabor that but uh the people we predicted to do poorly did poorly in other words the the uh this is the hamilton depression rating scale and this is the change uh two weeks after a two week treatment and and so most of them have uh less than a 20 percent uh improvement which is not good uh 50 percent is considered a decent outcome and all the people who had that except this one left-handed woman um were predicted to do well in other words their left hemisphere was by this simple goggle test positive and and and they responded very well to the tms um and um and i replicated it with a a group in canada so these are two papers that we publish and we got the same result in canada and there was a sexual difference between males and females males responded they were a little more predictable than females and we got the same gender difference in both sides uh and uh and i just want to i think there's a picture up here um yeah here uh so this is a fmri study showing that when people were in the scanner these are seven people from our lab and and they look to the left for 30 seconds look to the right for 30 seconds and then repeat that and then this is the the combined data of seven people if you look at one person you don't see this but with the combined seven people uh and then uh we can intensify the image uh it shows that uh so they're looking to the left here and it actually activates the right brain this is by an fmri which which shows blood flow uh in in the uh brain rather than in one hemisphere relatives to the other and then when they just look the other way uh it shifts so so that we have um uh uh fmri evidence that this is a real phenomena that's happening and it's happening in broad areas of the brain so it's just like one little area that's just you know in the back of the brain the observable area um it's the entire hemisphere almost yeah yeah it is and um um uh and then this is interesting this is a paper that we have uh we're about to submit uh that we we have a computer test to instead of using the uh glasses or uh hands or an envelope and um and what we found was that the nucleus accumbens the laterality index which is the left there are two nucleus accumbens so most people don't think of it that way there are two hippocampus there's a left and right and a left and right amygdala so if you take the left minus the right over the left plus the right you get what we call laterality index and and what we found was that the uh hemispheric valence uh which is what the test result is in other words uh if you're more depressed on one side than the other uh then we uh we'll um we'll say your uh left hemispheres is uh positive uh plus uh five or something and um uh so there's a correlation between the the laterality index of the nucleus accumbens it's highly significant with the valence so if you if you have a left positive valence if your left brain is positive your nucleus accumbens on the left side is larger than if if you have um sorry uh if if you um uh so if if your left is positive your nucleus accumbens is larger uh uh uh on the left side then the right side and and the same with the hippocampus with the amygdala it's actually smaller on the left side and so it's very interesting so you have the the reward center and the fear center in opposite directions uh just with with the the hemispheric valence that we're measuring um uh either with the computer with this we use the computer test but you can use either uh the the goggles or an envelope for that so uh i couldn't uh carry a tms machine uh up to my office uh so i i wanted um uh and i couldn't afford one yeah so uh i wanted something i could uh because i tried to get alvaro and other uh the the group at mclean that does a lot of tms trying to get them to stimulate to put the the magnet on the right side of the head and people that the simple test showed uh might benefit them and and it turns out that the tms has a benefit of about fifty percent uh in about half about half of people benefit from it and and um and so if they uh followed uh this test uh it might be possible that they could double uh uh their efficacy and their efficacy is just borderline it's uh and people usually have to go back and and get retreated and so it doesn't work in a lot of people and but i couldn't get anybody to to uh put the magnet on the right side so i i gave a cold call to the wellman center at mgh it's the enrollment center for photo medicine and uh and i said i knew a little bit about a near-infrared light and um and had used a near-infrared spectroscopy in some of my earlier studies and so i knew it went through the skull and [Music] so my first question was would it be safe to put on the head and the person i spoke to said well if you don't hurt the skin you're not going to hurt the brain because the power falls off exponentially and so i i got passed around a few people who weren't really that interested and then uh uh there was a guy and we sort of hit it off uh we had like a nice connection and his name was mike and i had no idea who he was and and um uh and uh and we got talking and and uh and we decided to do a pilot study and and uh and uh we we got great results from it the the uh mike turned out to be mike michael hamlin uh uh who uh has written 700 papers on photobiomodulation and written or edited 17 books and so up with the right person you stumbled into the right person for sure he's done so much for photobiomodulation yes yeah yeah um uh he's he's really the leader and and uh so i might have the results uh uh um so yeah this is the so this is the paper we published um um in in uh uh 2009 uh and uh there were ten patients and a lot of them none of them were active uh substance abuse users but they had histories of uh substance um abuse and so this was the device that uh we made uh uh mike um uh heard about this led that had just come out and uh and so uh this is a a computer fan on top and a heat sink and you can see the heat sink here this is the uh the led itself so it's it's a homemade device i had an engineer in cambridge make the power supply and and these are two uh near infrared spectroscopy uh pads uh the somanetics device and uh and we really didn't need the goggles but we didn't know that then so we we have safety goggles on and um and then we've found that there was a change in blood flow more in man than in women and and and then two weeks after one treatment we had a dramatic decrease uh in the hamilton score went from 29 to 11 uh two weeks later and then it went uh up at four weeks to 17. so it was still uh about half of what it was initially um and this is just a sorry this is just a unilateral application of light no we're not talking bilateral which i think we've seen a lot of studies that you know irradiate both sides of the head or the entire head well now this is uh actually bilateral although we did some measurements after each side and there were uh significant unilateral effects but we weren't uh i didn't want to get into uh dual brain psychology because it was too weird and it was hard enough to get irb approval at mgh we did the study at mgh and uh so uh we decided to to do both sides uh but the interesting thing is that although uh we got these uh uh really great results um um um this is uh okay this is uh the the depression the anxiety score is actually a little bit better and nobody said boy i feel great or uh wow can i have another treatment in other words uh the only way that we knew that there was any effect was we gave them the hamilton at two weeks and hamilton at four weeks and the scores showed an improvement but the patients themselves uh it weren't like the guy with looking at one side or the other with the goggles and it had this huge change you could see immediately um so at a meeting at mclean someone suggested well why don't you try it in your practice as an off-label uh uh treatment uh the the unilateral treatment so i i did that and um and i got uh from the get-go amazing results and and um um i have uh a audio recording i can play for you if you like um uh would you like to hear that uh yes a patient being treated okay so uh here's a guy who had uh trauma as a child and um he had a lot of operations and had a feeling of hopelessness because they always went bad and they had to be redone and and um and so he suffered a depression his suppression was better but he he he was coming in once a month and um uh and his complaint this time was that uh he's an amateur songwriter uh he has another job uh and uh so he hasn't been able to write and we we felt that uh it was related to the pessimism that he had as a child and so what we did was i i do a lot of weird stuff i'll use a sham or uh sometimes a patient will say to me doc it's not working and i go over and i look i didn't turn the right button on and uh uh if you put it over the negative hemisphere uh you get a an aggravation of of their symptoms so you know it's not uh horrible and and they don't go crazy but they uh so in this uh patient i put it over his negative hemisphere and then uh his positive atmosphere so you can hear the difference just just right before you hit play on this one if i can just try and because i think we might have um i mean this is so complex if i can just try to say back to you kind of what dual brain psychology is before we see these effects basically you have and this is not for a split patient this is for your average patient that's right but you have two different personalities two different people one in the left one in the right and it is varied per person as to which side is more mature versus which side is more childlike i guess and so more traumatized so it's only a child but it's a traumatized child okay and so then when we say when you say the positive hemisphere is that the more traumatized side no no that's the the more mature healthier side perfect okay so the negative side is more traumatized the positive hemisphere is the more mature side right okay and and if you treat that with tms the patients tend to do better okay if you treat the immature uh traumatized side you're stimulating it and so they do worse i see okay but it's not uh you're not treating uh in this to make the side healthier uh what we're doing is we're stimulating the brain like with the magnet so the magnet isn't repairing anything it's just stimulating uh uh hemisphere yes okay perfect thank you for letting me kind of recap good okay so [Music] that's the fan on the device oh and i've got a picture of a very angry man that he's looking at and the picture is symmetrical it's the same half of the face on both sides so if he looks at out of one visual field or the other it's the same picture let's see look the question is how do you feel about writing music i feel like uh i don't feel good about it i um i feel like it's worth picking up the kind of real discourage um there's a lot of uh a lot of stuff that i'll write and then immediately i put the pen down because i feel like it's automatically not going to come out worthwhile it's not automatically does that have anything my experiences in the hospital where uh where where i automatically felt um or automatically experienced like unexpected uh unexpected complications and it just seemed like everything always went bad and uh it's the same thing i feel like referring to this this project when i write it's like almost not even worth trying because it's not going to work out like you know that's that's i feel like it's that's what i see as a pattern as he gets treated it's a little worse but but it's sort of the way he came in i don't think i do very well [Music] yeah definitely i feel like uh attention [Music] all right so let's move it over to the other side okay usually the effect takes about two and a half minutes and it's a four minute treatment happens about two and a half minutes if i i'm going to stay true on another side yeah so now you're switching yeah if you do the the positive side after the first uh f to the negative side uh the patients well and and and uh it's as if you didn't ever did the negative side is so much it's like diminished so much [Music] all right now how does a guy look in the picture that looks funny i mean this is a ferocious [Music] maybe it looks like he's laughing and this is the same picture he already looked at yeah is in the same place and he's looking with both eyes this is photobiomodulation i love writing but i feel like you know i still feel like there's a part of me that's afraid or hesitant but i'm not like it's not a sense of it's not a sense where it's not worth doing well could you write something now yeah i feel like a little more um inspired to write or uh i don't feel like i'm impeded by my automatic assumption that's gonna be bad so yeah i would say so yeah i feel very different now that's like flipping a switch yeah now it takes again about two and a half minutes whereas the envelope for some reason works immediately just generally feel like that you know i walked in here it was a great day and now it's not so great anymore that's the best way to describe it like the lens the lenses are a little more the tent is a little lighter but there are opportunities for you [Music] go down the place okay i think wow that's that's wow um so um uh what uh what i do with this is um uh see if i tell him uh you know you're safe now uh and uh you can go ahead and write and so it doesn't mean anything and it'll be useless but uh what i'm doing is creating an experience where he he can feel his power he can feel that he's safer and and that's uh very compelling it's sort of like groucho marx uh once said uh uh what are you gonna believe uh uh what you see with your lion eyes or what i tell you and uh explains to the patient what his problem is and and and what his trauma is and also uh usually the trauma is hidden you know in other words these people there are patients of mine who who've been uh brutally traumatized uh vietnam bad or a lot of childhood trauma uh but uh uh probably the majority of people are traumatized uh in a way that they don't understand uh uh as a trauma uh in other words uh one one patient uh had a very intellectual family and and um they always had debates at the dinner table and uh and the result was always uh that my patient had the better uh uh responses but the other guy won the debate he was an older brother and and uh this you know caused a lifelong suffering so it doesn't look like a trauma you know looks like it's a very healthy family and they're doing this constructive thing but it turned out that actually it was traumatizing to to the patient and um uh so uh so part of this work is to discover the traumas uh and um and then you you can uh bring them out or uh uh or bring out the mature side where the traumas don't uh exist uh much on that side and and so with um uh with drug abuse uh what i found was that the patients would come in with very strong cravings i'd give them a unilateral treatment and the cravings would go away i i would look better they would feel better about themselves and and uh and and they wouldn't uh uh you know they would have no uh desire to use uh one patient uh came in he he had an overwhelming urge to gamble and uh and i said well you know i have a casino in the back but unfortunately there's a cover charge uh and uh so we had an auction and and we got up to two thousand dollars that he was willing to pay to go to my imaginary casino and yeah he knew you know i was an imaginary uh but but it was a you know we we both got into it and and uh and then i treated him and he wouldn't pay me anything yeah uh-huh and uh so uh we decided to test it uh uh with uh uh drug addicts who i didn't know so this is a tree this is a uh a test um uh of people from craigslist to uh the criteria was that they had to have cravings they didn't have to be using but they had to have uh four out of ten cravings uh on the telephone and uh and uh and it's very hard to study psychotherapy and and there's so many variables and so we just studied uh putting uh the light or a sham and a sham is is the same device with the piece of foil over the light and and the patients can't tell from the device which it is they can tell by how they feel uh and and uh and actually in this uh study that i'm studies i'm going to describe uh the patients all thought they got the actual treatment and they didn't uh so so it was it's a really good sham uh treatment and uh but but so the patients come in from craigslist i don't know them uh we're very friendly you know we want them to come back and you know we're pleasant and uh so there there is that and they all came back and they got paid uh and and uh you know so it was uh i think about thirty dollars and section and you know which was a lot of money for them and uh um and so we we i only had one dropout uh and uh and so i did a portion of the study from a startup company uh called mine light that i have and uh and and the other group uh was in mclean hospital and this is your i'm sorry this is your most recent study that was just published well right that's right yeah the the earlier study because i didn't know if we'd get the grant uh i funded myself and did it myself uh i had 17 people come in from craigslist and and um so let me let's see if i have this study here so this is the first study that we did and and so this was a within subject trial so there there were 17 uh people who came in i think we had about three dropouts and uh and the first week that they came in they got either a sham uh or um an active treatment and uh and i treated the negative first and then the positive because i wanted to see if there was a difference between the positive and negative hemisphere and um uh but we we treated the positive hemisphere second so i may have reduced the results by treating the negative hemisphere i i don't know that uh but i wanted to get that other thing so this was the first study that we did and uh uh [Music] so the the first week they got shammer active and the second week they got the opposite treatment and the third week they got a follow-up and we measured um cravings and we we looked at use we didn't have enough data to get a good use analysis and that wasn't a requirement for uh coming into the study and um and we also measured depression and so [Music] what we found was that there was a decrease in cravings [Music] at the week three in the group they got the active treatment they had a 55 decrease versus an 18 decrease uh in the sham group and that was a uh statistically significant with a healthy effect size of 0.73 0.8 is considered a high effect size and and effect size is sort of the power of uh the effect so if if if you give a prozac uh you have to wait around and three weeks and you look at tea leaves and try and figure out whether it's working or not so that has a low effect size so you need 3 000 people to see if it works so that way that wasn't me the computer decide i gotta change slides so this is uh the hamilton depression scores so they came in at uh 15 and went down to nine which is uh quite nice uh now this is a week after the treatment so right after the treatment we didn't see a difference a significant difference between the act and the active and sham but a week later it was that difference so so that that's interesting that it took uh uh it wasn't like in my office where we got the the immediate results and and and the patients didn't they found it pleasant but they didn't have these amazing responses i i don't know why uh uh you know it might be a patient selection um but they did have a um a week later a um uh uh highly significant decrease in depression which which is of course important and this was just after the one four minute session of active light treatment that's right yeah and and and but it's a week later uh if i uh and you can't do a hamilton uh immediately after anyway you know it's just it's a little too complicated this is a study showing that the uh active treatment was much better than the um uh it's into the positive hemisphere was much better than to the negative hemisphere it was significant uh uh when the light was off there was no difference so so uh it does indicate that there's a positive negative hemisphere uh and uh uh so we we couldn't look at that a week later uh uh and then so this was the second study which was funded by um a small business innovation uh research grant from the national institute of drug abuse and nih and um so in this study uh we recruited um actually it turned out to be 39 studies 39 patients and and what we found so this is all 39 in this graph here this is from the paper uh so uh people either got an active treatment where they got a sham treatment and they came in twice a week and they came in uh for four weeks so this is the treatment period this is the follow-up and you'll see that this is the active group and this is the decrease in um cravings from the baseline so uh it's a ten point scale and and so there's a five point decrease in the ten point scale so they didn't come in at ten they came in let's say seven and they go down to two so it's really a difference between whether you're going to use or not uh if if your craving is two you're not going to use if it's seven you're going to use and and uh so so this is uh these are uh clinically significant uh results uh in my opinion well especially sorry just especially since we have such a huge issue with opioid abuse and overuse and and overdose deaths i mean we were at they were they were saying 90 000 plus uh deaths related to opioids just in 2020 alone and this is a major problem and there's not a lot of really good treatments to help control brain and again this is just a four-minute light treatment that's what that's what this uh uh picture is here okay there's no other treatment but photo modulation and and pleasantness we were pleasant but we were pleasant in the sham group and there was a a placebo response you know it went down a point and a half at the follow-up now now the effect size here and here at the week after the last treatment and again we we saw that a week later we got better results than immediately uh i don't know why that is but um uh but uh the difference between here and here and here and here is 1.5 uh the effect size is 1.5 uh a high effect size is eight is is point eight rather so this is twice high and and it's a and the p value is off the chart you know it's all zeros uh and uh so uh again all we did was so i think we could you know go out into the community with a light and and treat people and and and get good results that lasted three weeks um after the treatment and uh we weren't able to do a long-term follow-up we just didn't have a manpower for it yeah that's hard yeah and um uh and uh just some other things here so uh in in the uh whole active treatment group there was a 70 decrease in uh cravings uh in the sham group there was a uh about a 30 decrease so there was a a healthy placebo effect but it was uh you know half of the uh the treatment effect so the treatment was significantly improved over sham and that shows i think too that you had a good sham it's a really pretty clever just doing everything the exact same just covering the light with foil that's really simple but highly effective yeah and and and everybody uh uh you know except there were about two patients who did really poorly and and they thought they got the sham that's why how they did you know but but uh most people thought they got the active treatment when when they in fact got the sham and the axis treatment people thought they got the active treatment uh and uh and this just shows the the group comparison and uh and then uh uh the results uh mine light is as a company and uh and we we got uh highly significant results and mclean uh got very similar results we both got down to about minus five uh actually looks like mclean did slightly better uh uh um uh although their sham group did better uh that required for some reason um um and and then uh people on buprenorphine uh uh did well with the treatment so if if someone was on buprenorphine uh with the sham treatment they didn't improve further than what the buprenorphine did but but the uh uh the people who were on buprenorphine uh with the active treatment uh had a uh went down to four so it wasn't you know quite as as as good as the um uh looks like i think this group i think actually went down past five uh to about six um um so that's again it's a ten point scale and if you if you go down six points uh again if you come in at a seven and you go down to a one uh that's remarkable uh yes in my opinion yes and and uh so i i could see this as an add-on to buprenorphine here uh or a standalone treatment and uh and then this is a drug use and at mclean they got a much better uh decrease in drug use and i think the reason is uh they had more people who were using drugs than we had in my life and and using drug use was not a requirement uh but it turns out that we got significant results with drug use so this is decrease in drug use over the course of the treatment and and uh so these are days of use and and in the sharing group there they tended to be increases uh and uh and this is the same thing with uh the uh uh uh look back uh follow back uh method so this is the days times the amount of use and you see really a healthy uh decrease in use and again it's a sub population because most of the people weren't uh using but it was out of the 39 i think about 14 or so we're using uh uh where it came in using and and uh and and decrease um and uh and this is uh days of uh so the the treated group had uh almost 100 days less of use than a baseline uh whereas the sharing group had nine days less baseline so there was there was a a healthy uh uh improvement in in use as as well as um so these are opiate screens what we found was that the patients often had negative urines um uh when they reported that they had used and i think because there's a lot of fentanyl out there and that didn't show up in the urine test so the findings are based on dual brain psychology and they reinforce uh the dual brain psychology premises which they are that there's a different personality in each hemisphere related to childhood trauma and they show that unilateral transcranial photobiomodulation dramatically reduces opioid cravings and use and it's safe and this doesn't conflict with other medications yeah we had absolutely no side effects you didn't have a headache or a uh an ache or a pain we had no complaints and i don't have any in my practice um um it's it's uh and it's known to be safe it's not just my uh finding but uh uh and then it was concerned that well what if you put it on the wrong hemisphere you know you make a monster and no you don't uh you you know you you'll bring the person to his regressed state but he's been living in that most of his life and and so it's uh it's it's it's not a a great risk so you know the this is this is a big deal really if you think about the amount of problems we have uh at least here in the u.s with opioid use and cravings and and abuse and and like we mentioned before overdoses so you'd think that a really significant study like this it shows really good effects it's completely safe that is uh you know really naughty it's it's convenient i mean it's a few minutes of a treatment yeah and it's painless it's pleasant you know uh people feel better with it um uh there it really isn't a negative uh here that i can say you'd think this would be just everywhere like that everybody'd be on board and doing it right i mean that's what it seems like to me uh right now we're trying to get it through the fda and we have to do another study we have a grant application uh and it's another sbir grant it's a larger grant and if we complete that i think we'll have a good shot at getting fda approval so we don't have fda approval yet and and so we haven't uh uh go into a commercialization phase and we do have a patent one on the unilateral uh and we we have another uh um we had we had some other patent spending and uh so uh uh we're we are we're trying to commercialize it but we we uh uh you know would uh have tried you know to offer it to the city of boston and nobody's called me back i i i've i've made uh you know at least 10 calls at drug clinics and and uh uh halfway houses and stuff and uh um uh maybe it's too weird or something well you know if you're not familiar with photobiomodulation the idea of you know shining a light onto the brain just it sounds like it's crazy it says it sounds like it's not gonna change um and and maybe i'll say a few words too about the mechanism yeah so we know a lot about uh uh you know uh chromophores and and atp and and cytochrome c and and mitochondria uh this probably isn't working on that basis it does increase blood flow but that probably is a secondary phenomena i don't think it's the primary phenomenon my uh my guess is that it has to do with changing your mind uh and and for that i think uh we need to be thinking about uh quantum physics and uh uh and so uh i've written about uh brain information and uh and subjective experience and so what we're doing is we're altering subjective experience and uh that comes out of different brain information so i'm sure that the different hemispheres have different brain information uh but what we're doing is we're changing the subjective experience that's associated with that brain information and and uh so i i i think we get into quantum field theory and some stuff that i'm not really qualified to speak upon well of course me either but this is fascinating stuff um and i think you know you have to have seen i mean not you already mentioned it but you have to have seen your field change so much over the last you know 20 30 years i mean thinking about where we're going to learn what we're going to find out in the next 10 even uh has to be really exciting so it's it's pretty neat to see i think researchers like yourself that are willing to go out on a limb and say i know this is this seems weird but what if we put these concepts together and seeing neat results like this yeah it's really encouraging to neuroscience and that uh i don't think it's a small area of the brain that consciousness is related to uh and and i don't think that uh i think circuits are involved but they're not the key thing in other words it's uh we have to get back to minds and psychiatry has lost its mind uh and uh we've gotten their drugs in in place of it and and the drugs are not that effective uh you can get half normal with drugs if you're lucky if you don't get worse wow yeah well doc i appreciate your time today and if you're listening and you want to find out more about the two recent studies that dr schiffer and his team have published you can find those full studies at the links here in the show notes and you can also hear my breakdown of those studies by going back to episode 31 and episode 80. we'll put links in the show notes to that too where i actually run down some of the details directly from the research but you're hearing from the guy himself today and he has a publication we already mentioned it's titled of two minds the second edition just came out you can find that on amazon there will be a link to that book in the show notes as well and then if you're learning about photobiomodulation you want to know more if you're looking for the right type of device for you and your practice if you need assistance with safety and certification training or protocols and settings you can look us up laser therapyinstitute.org we have so many resources available many of them for free and really targeted to the individual in practice but doc i i really again appreciate your time and your attention and your efforts in this really important field do you have anything else you wanted to share with us before we go today well just to say thank you i've enjoyed speaking with you and and and the opportunity to share my work well thank you and i look forward to seeing more from you in the near future you,"hey welcome back to the laser therapy institute podcast my name is dr jason rountree i'll be your host again today but i'm joined by a very special guest we have dr fred schiffer here with us he attended drexel university school of medicine where he earned his md and that was followed by residencies in internal medicine and psychiatry as well as a cardiology fellowship

he is a board certified physician and psychiatrist

he is a research associate at mclean hospital

he's an assistant professor of psychiatry part-time at harvard medical school

and he was a speaker at the 2021 photobiomodulation summit

he's also a published author and he currently sees patients at his office in newton highlands massachusetts as well as via telehealth dr schiffer welcome to the podcast

hi pleasure to be here

i'm very excited to have you here we have some really interesting things to cover today a couple of neat concepts a couple of things that are being done with photobiomodulation or light therapy that really is stunning so first though let's let's kind of start back in the beginning if you don't mind tell me about your interest in medicine where did you get started with this whole thing

uh okay i think you mean my interest in uh photobiomodulation

well yes i'm very interested to know how you got involved in photobiomodulation or are you interested in how i got into medicine and psychiatry here

i would love to hear a little on you need like your initial interest in medicine

sure in medical school i had no thought of going into psychiatry i was i did an internship in internal medicine and residency and internal medicine and then did a fellowship in cardiology at harvard and and um and that fellowship was a research fellowship on stress and and uh heart disease and um and then to complete my education uh i did a residency uh in psychiatry uh at mclean and uh i was thinking of becoming sort of a psycho cardiologist and uh and what i found was that uh no one was interested in that but the cardiologist gave lip service to stress and stuff they didn't really want to go deeply into it and and it turned out that it it was there was a lot to in that field i i did a rotation at mass general and i was in working in the icu and everybody who came in with a heart attack had a very interesting psychological story

and um uh uh one guy uh just notice for the cardiologist he just had a heart attack and came in but when i spoke to him uh his father died when he was uh 10 years old and his mother would wring her hands and say oh what are we going to do what are we going to do and he would say don't worry i'll take care of it and he did that all his life and and so the night of the heart attack he was out to dinner with his business partner and they had some problems and and business partners said well you know i'm going to take a vacation and uh and and his usual response was well don't worry i'll take care of it but uh this time he couldn't and had a heart attack and and and he could relate to that and and uh so there really was a lot to that uh field but but it i wasn't able to uh promote it uh and so i became a a standard psychiatrist and and i love psychiatry and and uh um um and uh but i i was always interested in kind of thinking about things and not not just learning road techniques and and uh so at that time uh freud was uh uh the the and freudian psychiatry was uh uh in in vogue and and and you you didn't see a psychopharmacologist they were kind of weird people on the periphery and uh uh so this was uh uh 1975 i started my residency at mclean and it was a three-year residency and um and then i stayed on at mclean as an attending psychiatrist which essentially meant i had a private practice at mclean and then i had an outside private practice and and and i was noticing that my patients didn't seem uh to have um uh the uh is in egos uh that we talked about they're the superego in other words when i saw a patient it wasn't like like i understood what the id was and what the ego was and uh but it wasn't what i was really seeing uh was uh that the patient was in one personality when he was regressed and then as he got better he was like a different person and it was a whole different personality and and and that's what really struck me and and i tried to promote that idea uh about two minds and and um and it didn't go anywhere uh and um uh it's very hard to promote a new idea

and uh and then uh in 1990 uh i was on vacation with my family in england in the english countryside and i was reading a book uh about the split brain studies and i had you know studied it in college but i didn't really understand what it meant so uh the these uh studies um uh were done for people with uh terrible epilepsy that their lives were they completely disrupted by constant seizures and so there was a drastic uh treatment uh which was to cut the connection between the two halves of the brain so the brain is sort of like a walnut has two wrinkled halves which is the left and right brain and there's a stem between the two and the stems with the corpus callosum and uh so the the foot brain operation uh was uh i'm gonna turn off my uh uh mail oh sure okay um so the footprint operations were uh done by dr joseph bogan and uh and they were dr roger sperry who won the nobel prize for the these studies was at cal tech and he was the physiologist uh in the studies and and uh they went on for about 10 years and and so the the important finding there are like a lot of weird stories about a woman is buttoning her dress to put it on and unbuttoning your dress with her other hand and and it was hard to kind of make sense of what this really meant but as i reread it uh what i saw was that each hemisphere of the brain in his foot brain patients had a mind of his own uh that that when you cut the the corpus callosum you actually had two intelligent people uh and uh and they both understood english and could do commands uh very easily and had a sense of humor and um uh the the difference was that the left brain could talk speeches as we know uh in in most people is in the left uh hemisphere and and uh so the right isolated right hemisphere was mute but he could talk with hand signals uh it could point to uh uh scrabble chips uh in in actually in one patient he he could spell uh words and and uh uh he's he's his left brain speaking said that he wanted to become a draftsman and uh pointing to scrambled chips he wrote a racecar driver

uh had you had to say to uh you see uh different personalities or different intentions uh

right but they're both intelligent so they both understood the this sort of complex question but what do you want to be when you grow up he was a teenager and so if you showed a picture the uh the eyes are connected to the brain in an interesting way and i have a diagram of it if you want to see that

that'd be great

okay
[Music]
so the way the eyes are connected to the hemisphere so here's the split brain patient the connections is uh cut here and if you show an image to the left side it it goes uh through the lens and hits the medial retina and crosses over uh and stimulates the uh goes first to the back of the brain but actually stimulates the uh the brain in that uh the person uh the the right brain only can see the picture uh if you ask the the person who can speak in his left brain he says i can't see it and then if you have a box here with 10 items in it uh with his uh uh left hand which is controlled by his right brain he can easily reach into the box and and pull out the chest piece the uh right arm and right hand is connected to the left brain and if you put the same box on the other side the uh right hand has no idea what to pick because as the person told you you didn't see it uh and if you put the item over here uh the right brain can't see it and the left brain will say uh oh it's a chest piece it's a um it looks like a uh uh i think it's a queen you might be a king huh um yeah okay
[Music]
so uh uh what i found the that the most important aspect of the slow brain studies was that you had an intelligent person in the right brain uh who could answer questions and uh actually these are uh this is roger sperry uh over here this is joe bogan and this is iran zeidel who who actually died a few months ago uh and i went out and did a study with uh bogan and zydell as uh sperry had died by that time and um um and so this these are studies that uh sperry did where they'd put a word on one side of the um so both sides could read and uh so one side of the screen tooth goes only to the uh right brain and brush goes only to the uh left brain and uh and so he the person will say brush because he can speak and then he can reach over and pick out the tooth so i did a variation of that i did the first study uh which was a psychological interview of the two hemispheres and so uh on each side of the screen are different words uh each uh hemisphere sees uh the they they each see 35 words and and they're pairs so here it's a admired or disrespected ashamed admired attracted dishonest and uh uh uh trying to uh have positive and negative words and then the uh person would point with his uh hand to uh there were five pegs um and uh and and his response would be uh non-mild moderate predator extreme and we got very um consistent responses and and what we found was in in one patient uh his right hemisphere was happier and and and so the positive responses were higher in the uh right brain than in the left brain and the negative responses were lower and and this was statistically significant the other patient uh had been bullied as a child and he told me that it didn't bother him it happened so long ago uh but uh when i asked the the questions uh his uh left-hand uh signing for his right mute right brain said that he was extremely upset by the bullies and and i put in a bunch of bully questions i kind of made up and um

so yeah this was with a split brain patient yeah

correct okay okay yeah okay uh but it gave me the idea that maybe um uh uh what uh what i was um uh seeing uh where i was seeing two different personalities in my patients rather than a need and an ego which which exists and which i understand um uh maybe there was some connection between the footbrain studies and and so um uh uh uh let's just give a little so uh werner whitling was a german uh uh scientist and uh he developed a very complex device to show movies in normal people to one hemisphere or the other and it was very difficult to follow what his protocol was he was tracking eye movements and masking a computer screen and and i had to read it several times to understand what he was doing and and and then i i figured out what he was doing and and he was just showing the movie to the lateral visual field so he was really doing the same thing that's very did uh putting the the picture to one side and so i came up with uh my own version which i could afford a lot more direct you just cover that opposite visual field then okay

right right so so and then i had the goggles uh made uh and and then they i think sort of hurt me because they look sort of goofy but they were very effective in um and what what we found was that uh if a person looked out one side and i didn't and it could be left or right and varied within people uh their personality would be very different and they would say that i looked very critical on one side and they didn't like themselves and they might have drug cravings and then i'd have them look out the other side and i looked better and they liked themselves more and their cravings went away and uh and it happened immediately it was a so the first time i tried it i just i i tried it myself and didn't respond uh i i did respond uh about five years later uh uh in an interesting uh uh way um but my first um trial with this uh i had a um my first patient that day was a vietnam vet and um uh and he had severe ptsd had a purple heart and i'd had uh three or four tours of duty and and his face screwed up uh when i asked him to look out uh at one side and uh uh and i i think it was his uh uh uh right visual field so it would be his left brain and and he said that plant behind you looks like the jungle and i said really uh and i said look out the other side and he smiles he says no it's a nice looking plant and i I knew that I had something and and and the rest of my when I do this with patients all the time now i i get um about 55 of people have these really strong responses and and about another 30 percent will have a uh positive response but it might like their anxiety level might be like a one or two point difference uh between sides uh this guy would would go from like an eight to a two

wow

and uh um so uh the hypothesis is so what i call this is dual brain psychology and and then uh just started at dual brain institute to teach i have seminars to teach clinicians how to do this because it's it's tricky in how to learn it and how to put it into your practice but it's very useful in in psychotherapy uh to have a person who feels really depressed and they don't see any future and they look out the other side and they they feel better and then there's hope and and um so one question would be you know is it always the left side is it always the right side no that's a very important point that i thought uh and i wrote some papers on it that I'd like to retract I never did uh and they're they're well sighted um uh they decided all the time and that is that I thought all the i wrote papers thinking that the right brain was like the unconscious or the negative hemisphere and that's sort of the popular notion but what I found is it's about half and half and that a lot of times ptsd is more in the left brain uh but but I think uh it's it's impossible to know uh it's possible for me to know unless I test somebody which side is uh more positive but but everybody who responds has the same response it's that one side feels good i look good and the other side uh i i look critical and and and their personality changes their physical uh appearance changes uh in in people who have intense responses and and they're they'll often say to me you know my chest pain went away i didn't know they're having chest pain i i've i've had uh patients uh uh have i just generally feel better and and their pain often decreases uh it's it's uh often i i had some examples uh uh uh kind of amazing so i did a a a study um um so here's a this is kind of the theory so here there's a healthy side and a uh here's a real mean looking guy there actually this is an interesting um i let me let me before i get this is a maybe I might come back to this if we have time this is a transcript from a patient who had a strong response and you see the psychology but it's not just that he feels good uh it it involves his the problems that he had he i treated him for cocaine addiction he did well and i had him come back and um oh I'll read a little bit of it here uh uh and so I asked him uh how he feels I don't know which side he's looking looking at uh uh and I'm getting away from your question so I so I don't know which side in a given patient and we use that uh to study uh uh rtms and I'll show you that and that's how I got to uh photobiomodulation

okay so it's coming up here but but I'll just say read this uh quickly uh uh I asked him how he feels anxious because I can't see what might be coming at me from the other side just a new feeling or familiar feeling I'd say sort of a familiar because I'm in business and you never know what's about to happen definitely unknown now it's interesting he doesn't connect with his psychology it's just you know he feels
[Music]
uh would better try on the other goggles uh so I had two pairs of goggles and uh uh how much anxiety are you feeling looking out the left side so this is his right brain uh I think glass mild can you describe the difference between how you feel on one side versus the other I'm more relaxed on this side on the other side I'm more uptight let's put the other pair back on how do you feel same as before not as comfortable I'm just thinking about things that I did in the past and everything about me then I really didn't think about anybody but myself and the abuse and some of those things I've been through in life it's not what I want to remember not good can I take them off

wow it's really you know intense but uh I just want to ask one more question and say I okay can you relate these uncomfortable feelings to your father I see I treated him for two years and so I knew this you know that his father was important uh to his uh addiction uh I don't know I was never comfortable around my father with these glasses on it's sort of like dealing with him again because it's always the unknown always a pressure and a problem yeah you feel the unknown you have the tension and then he talked about the unknown in business but it really ties back to the unknown with his father we didn't know when his father was going to criticize him uh and uh so and I asked him later on it what would it take him to use drugs and he says he was looking at the good side I would never do that and I said how about the other side and said you know I think I could see myself doing it on the other side

um wow so this is a my book here um and and joseph bogan wrote on the uh cover uh wonderfully readable well-informed this is the best book ever on the social and psychiatric implications of this foot brain research and and candace perk who discovered the opiate receptor said the schiffer rivals freud in his revolutionary theories on understating the human psyche now I learned later that she was talking about ludwig freud who was sigmund's uh brother who was a baker I'm sure not uh so uh so this is the second edition which uh uh has a a preface that brings up the uh this first came out in 1998 and has a lot of transcripts like the one I read to you and then there's been a a whole bunch of research that we've published at mclean uh since the book came out so that's it included in the uh second edition

when when did the second edition come out

in august of this year brand new

awesome yeah yeah okay um uh so I I took my goggles down to alvaro pasqualione who at that time uh was a well-known researcher he still is and uh but he at that time he was uh a pioneer in uh uh uh transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a treatment for depression and uh and uh for for reasons that aren't clear to me uh they always stimulate the left side and uh so I predicted that if your left side was your negative side you wouldn't do well and if it was your positive side you would and uh and so he took the glasses and then I had trouble getting him to answer my emails or calls and so finally I I actually had to go to his office and and and and so over here is the data from a paper that we published and and this uh column here are the people who felt worse in their left brain so when they look to the right they have more depression and then they look to the left that's what that means and this is right visual field versus left visual field that's very positive okay yeah so down to the bottom it says that so so that the the um uh it's how depressed are you so if you're more depressed uh uh in the uh right visual field um well I know that this is the the negative uh this is uh the left negative um um I'm getting confused when I uh uh look at the label here but I'm not gonna uh belabor that but uh the people we predicted to do poorly did poorly in other words the the uh this is the hamilton depression rating scale and this is the change uh two weeks after a two week treatment and and so most of them have uh less than a 20 percent uh improvement which is not good uh 50 percent is considered a decent outcome and all the people who had that except this one left-handed woman um were predicted to do well in other words their left hemisphere was by this simple goggle test positive and and and they responded very well to the tms

and um and I replicated it with a a group in canada so these are two papers that we publish and we got the same result in canada and there was a sexual difference between males and females males responded they were a little more predictable than females and we got the same gender difference in both sides uh and uh and I just want to I think there's a picture up here um yeah here uh so this is a fmri study showing that when people were in the scanner these are seven people from our lab and and they look to the left for 30 seconds look to the right for 30 seconds and then repeat that and then this is the the combined data of seven people if you look at one person you don't see this but with the combined seven people uh and then uh we can intensify the image uh it shows that uh so they're looking to the left here and it actually activates the right brain this is by an fmri which which shows blood flow uh in in the uh brain rather than in one hemisphere relatives to the other and then when they just look the other way uh it shifts so so that we have um uh uh fmri evidence that this is a real phenomena that's happening and it's happening in broad areas of the brain so it's just like one little area that's just you know in the back of the brain the observable area

um it's the entire hemisphere almost yeah yeah it is and um um uh and then this is interesting this is a paper that we have uh we're about to submit uh that we we have a computer test to instead of using the uh glasses or uh hands or an envelope and um and what we found was that the nucleus accumbens the laterality index which is the left there are two nucleus accumbens so most people don't think of it that way there are two hippocampus there's a left and right and a left and right amygdala so if you take the left minus the right over the left plus the right you get what we call laterality index and and what we found was that the uh hemispheric valence uh which is what the test result is in other words uh if you're more depressed on one side than the other uh then we uh we'll um we'll say your uh left hemispheres is uh positive uh plus uh five or something and um uh so there's a correlation between the the laterality index of the nucleus accumbens it's highly significant with the valence so if you if you have a left positive valence if your left brain is positive your nucleus accumbens on the left side is larger than if if you have um sorry uh if if you um uh so if if your left is positive your nucleus accumbens is larger uh uh uh on the left side then the right side and and the same with the hippocampus with the amygdala it's actually smaller on the left side and so it's very interesting so you have the the reward center and the fear center in opposite directions uh just with with the the hemispheric valence that we're measuring um uh either with the computer with this we use the computer test but you can use either uh the the goggles or an envelope for that

so uh i couldn't uh carry a tms machine uh up to my office uh so i i wanted um uh and i couldn't afford one yeah so uh i wanted something i could uh because i tried to get alvaro and other uh the the group at mclean that does a lot of tms trying to get them to stimulate to put the the magnet on the right side of the head and people that the simple test showed uh might benefit them and and it turns out that the tms has a benefit of about fifty percent uh in about half about half of people benefit from it and and um and so if they uh followed uh this test uh it might be possible that they could double uh uh their efficacy and their efficacy is just borderline it's uh and people usually have to go back and and get retreated and so it doesn't work in a lot of people and but i couldn't get anybody to to uh put the magnet on the right side so i i gave a cold call to the wellman center at mgh it's the enrollment center for photo medicine and uh and i said i knew a little bit about a near-infrared light and um and had used a near-infrared spectroscopy in some of my earlier studies and so i knew it went through the skull and
[Music]
so my first question was would it be safe to put on the head and the person I spoke to said well if you don't hurt the skin you're not going to hurt the brain because the power falls off exponentially and so I I got passed around a few people who weren't really that interested and then uh uh there was a guy and we sort of hit it off uh we had like a nice connection and his name was mike and I had no idea who he was and and um uh and uh and we got talking and and uh and we decided to do a pilot study and and uh and uh we we got great results from it the the uh mike turned out to be mike michael hamlin uh uh who uh has written 700 papers on photobiomodulation and written or edited 17 books and so up with the right person

you stumbled into the right person for sure he's done so much for photobiomodulation

yes yeah yeah um uh he's he's really the leader and and uh so I might have the results uh uh um so yeah this is the so this is the paper we published um um in in uh uh 2009 uh and uh there were ten patients and a lot of them none of them were active uh substance abuse users but they had histories of uh substance um abuse and so this was the device that uh we made uh uh mike um uh heard about this led that had just come out and uh and so uh this is a a computer fan on top and a heat sink and you can see the heat sink here this is the uh the led itself so it's it's a homemade device I had an engineer in cambridge make the power supply and and these are two uh near infrared spectroscopy uh pads uh the somanetics device and uh and we really didn't need the goggles but we didn't know that then so we we have safety goggles on and um and then we've found that there was a change in blood flow more in man than in women and and and then two weeks after one treatment we had a dramatic decrease uh in the hamilton score went from 29 to 11 uh two weeks later and then it went uh up at four weeks to 17. so it was still uh about half of what it was initially

um and this is just a sorry this is just a unilateral application of light no we're not talking bilateral which I think we've seen a lot of studies that you know irradiate both sides of the head or the entire head

well now this is uh actually bilateral although we did some measurements after each side and there were uh significant unilateral effects but we weren't uh I didn't want to get into uh dual brain psychology because it was too weird and it was hard enough to get irb approval at mgh we did the study at mgh and uh so uh we decided to to do both sides uh but the interesting thing is that although uh we got these uh uh really great results um um um this is uh okay this is uh the the depression the anxiety score is actually a little bit better and nobody said boy I feel great or uh wow can I have another treatment in other words uh the only way that we knew that there was any effect was we gave them the hamilton at two weeks and hamilton at four weeks and the scores showed an improvement but the patients themselves uh it weren't like the guy with looking at one side or the other with the goggles and it had this huge change you could see immediately

um so at a meeting at mclean someone suggested well why don't you try it in your practice as an off-label uh uh treatment uh the the unilateral treatment so I I did that and um and I got uh from the get-go amazing results and and um um I have uh a audio recording I can play for you if you like um uh would you like to hear that

uh yes a patient being treated

okay so uh here's a guy who had uh trauma as a child and um he had a lot of operations and had a feeling of hopelessness because they always went bad and they had to be redone and and um and so he suffered a depression his suppression was better but he he he was coming in once a month and um uh and his complaint this time was that uh he's an amateur songwriter uh he has another job uh and uh so he hasn't been able to write and we we felt that uh it was related to the pessimism that he had as a child and so what we did was I I do a lot of weird stuff I'll use a sham or uh sometimes a patient will say to me doc it's not working and I go over and I look I didn't turn the right button on and uh uh if you put it over the negative hemisphere uh you get a an aggravation of of their symptoms so you know it's not uh horrible and and they don't go crazy but they uh so in this uh patient I put it over his negative hemisphere and then uh his positive atmosphere so you can hear the difference just just right before you hit play on this one if I can just try and because I think we might have um I mean this is so complex if I can just try to say back to you kind of what dual brain psychology is before we see these effects basically you have and this is not for a split patient this is for your average patient that's right but you have two different personalities two different people one in the left one in the right and it is varied per person as to which side is more mature versus which side is more childlike I guess and so more traumatized so it's only a child but it's a traumatized child okay and so then when we say when you say the positive hemisphere is that the more traumatized side no no that's the the more mature healthier side perfect okay so the negative side is more traumatized the positive hemisphere is the more mature side right okay and and if you treat that with tms the patients tend to do better okay if you treat the immature uh traumatized side you're stimulating it and so they do worse I see okay but it's not uh you're not treating uh in this to make the side healthier uh what we're doing is we're stimulating the brain like with the magnet so the magnet isn't repairing anything it's just stimulating uh uh hemisphere yes okay perfect thank you for letting me kind of recap good okay so
[Music]
that's the fan on the device oh and I've got a picture of a very angry man that he's looking at and the picture is symmetrical it's the same half of the face on both sides so if he looks at out of one visual field or the other it's the same picture let's see look the question is how do you feel about writing music I feel like uh I don't feel good about it I um I feel like it's worth picking up the kind of real discourage um there's a lot of uh a lot of stuff that I'll write and then immediately I put the pen down because I feel like it's automatically not going to come out worthwhile it's not automatically does that have anything my experiences in the hospital where uh where where I automatically felt um or automatically experienced like unexpected uh unexpected complications and it just seemed like everything always went bad and uh it's the same thing I feel like referring to this this project when I write it's like almost not even worth trying because it's not going to work out like you know that's that's I feel like it's that's what I see as a pattern as he gets treated it's a little worse but but it's sort of the way he came in I don't think I do very well
[Music]
yeah definitely I feel like uh attention
[Music]
All right so let's move it over to the other side okay usually the effect takes about two and a half minutes and it's a four minute treatment happens about two and a half minutes if I I'm going to stay true on another side yeah so now you're switching yeah if you do the the positive side after the first uh f to the negative side uh the patients well and and and uh it's as if you didn't ever did the negative side is so much it's like diminished so much
[Music]
All right now how does a guy look in the picture that looks funny I mean this is a ferocious
[Music]
maybe it looks like he's laughing and this is the same picture he already looked at yeah is in the same place and he's looking with both eyes this is photobiomodulation I love writing but I feel like you know I still feel like there's a part of me that's afraid or hesitant but I'm not like it's not a sense of it's not a sense where it's not worth doing well could you write something now yeah I feel like a little more um inspired to write or uh I don't feel like I'm impeded by my automatic assumption that's gonna be bad so yeah I would say so yeah I feel very different now that's like flipping a switch yeah now it takes again about two and a half minutes whereas the envelope for some reason works immediately just generally feel like that you know I walked in here it was a great day and now it's not so great anymore that's the best way to describe it like the lens the lenses are a little more the tent is a little lighter but there are opportunities for you
[Music]
go down the place okay I think

wow that's that's wow

um so um uh what uh what I do with this is um uh see if I tell him uh you know you're safe now uh and uh you can go ahead and write and so it doesn't mean anything and it'll be useless but uh what I'm doing is creating an experience where he he can feel his power he can feel that he's safer and and that's uh very compelling it's sort of like groucho marx uh once said uh uh what are you gonna believe uh uh what you see with your lion eyes or what I tell you and uh explains to the patient what his problem is and and and what his trauma is and also uh usually the trauma is hidden you know in other words these people there are patients of mine who who've been uh brutally traumatized uh vietnam bad or a lot of childhood trauma uh but uh uh probably the majority of people are traumatized uh in a way that they don't understand uh uh as a trauma uh in other words uh one one patient uh had a very intellectual family and and um they always had debates at the dinner table and uh and the result was always uh that my patient had the better uh uh responses but the other guy won the debate he was an older brother and and uh this you know caused a lifelong suffering so it doesn't look like a trauma you know looks like it's a very healthy family and they're doing this constructive thing but it turned out that actually it was traumatizing to to the patient and um uh so uh so part of this work is to discover the traumas uh and um and then you you can uh bring them out or uh uh or bring out the mature side where the traumas don't uh exist uh much on that side and and so with um uh with drug abuse uh what I found was that the patients would come in with very strong cravings I'd give them a unilateral treatment and the cravings would go away I I would look better they would feel better about themselves and and uh and and they wouldn't uh uh you know they would have no uh desire to use uh one patient uh came in he he had an overwhelming urge to gamble and uh and I said well you know I have a casino in the back but unfortunately there's a cover charge uh and uh so we had an auction and and we got up to two thousand dollars that he was willing to pay to go to my imaginary casino and yeah he knew you know I was an imaginary uh but but it was a you know we we both got into it and and uh and then I treated him and he wouldn't pay me anything yeah uh-huh and uh so uh we decided to test it uh uh with uh uh drug addicts who I didn't know so this is a tree this is a uh a test um uh of people from craigslist to uh the criteria was that they had to have cravings they didn't have to be using but they had to have uh four out of ten cravings uh on the telephone and uh and uh and it's very hard to study psychotherapy and and there's so many variables and so we just studied uh putting uh the light or a sham and a sham is is the same device with the piece of foil over the light and and the patients can't tell from the device which it is they can tell by how they feel uh and and uh and actually in this uh study that I'm studies I'm going to describe uh the patients all thought they got the actual treatment and they didn't uh so so it was it's a really good sham uh treatment and uh but but so the patients come in from craigslist I don't know them uh we're very friendly you know we want them to come back and you know we're pleasant and uh so there there is that and they all came back and they got paid uh and and uh you know so it was uh I think about thirty dollars and section and you know which was a lot of money for them and uh um and so we we I only had one dropout uh and uh and so I did a portion of the study from a startup company uh called mine light that I have and uh and and the other group uh was in mclean hospital and

this is your I'm sorry this is your most recent study that was just published

well right that's right yeah the the earlier study because I didn't know if we'd get the grant uh I funded myself and did it myself uh I had 17 people come in from craigslist and and um so let me let's see if I have this study here so this is the first study that we did and and so this was a within subject trial so there there were 17 uh people who came in I think we had about three dropouts and uh and the first week that they came in they got either a sham uh or um an active treatment and uh and I treated the negative first and then the positive because I wanted to see if there was a difference between the positive and negative hemisphere and um uh but we we treated the positive hemisphere second so I may have reduced the results by treating the negative hemisphere I I don't know that uh but I wanted to get that other thing so this was the first study that we did and uh uh
[Music]
so the the first week they got shammer active and the second week they got the opposite treatment and the third week they got a follow-up and we measured um cravings and we we looked at use we didn't have enough data to get a good use analysis and that wasn't a requirement for uh coming into the study and um and we also measured depression and so
[Music]
what we found was that there was a decrease in cravings
[Music]
at the week three in the group they got the active treatment they had a 55 decrease versus an 18 decrease uh in the sham group and that was a uh statistically significant with a healthy effect size of 0.73 0.8 is considered a high effect size and and effect size is sort of the power of uh the effect so if if if you give a prozac uh you have to wait around and three weeks and you look at tea leaves and try and figure out whether it's working or not so that has a low effect size so you need 3 000 people to see if it works so that way that wasn't me the computer decide I gotta change slides so this is uh the hamilton depression scores so they came in at uh 15 and went down to nine which is uh quite nice uh now this is a week after the treatment so right after the treatment we didn't see a difference a significant difference between the act and the active and sham but a week later it was that difference so so that that's interesting that it took uh uh it wasn't like in my office where we got the the immediate results and and and the patients didn't they found it pleasant but they didn't have these amazing responses I I don't know why uh uh you know it might be a patient selection um but they did have a um a week later a um uh uh highly significant decrease in depression which which is of course important and

this was just after the one four minute session of active light treatment

that's right yeah and and and but it's a week later uh if I uh and you can't do a hamilton uh immediately after anyway you know it's just it's a little too complicated this is a study showing that the uh active treatment was much better than the um uh it's into the positive hemisphere was much better than to the negative hemisphere it was significant uh uh when the light was off there was no difference so so uh it does indicate that there's a positive negative hemisphere uh and uh uh so we we couldn't look at that a week later uh uh and then so this was the second study which was funded by um a small business innovation uh research grant from the national institute of drug abuse and nih and um so in this study uh we recruited um actually it turned out to be 39 studies 39 patients and and what we found so this is all 39 in this graph here this is from the paper uh so uh people either got an active treatment where they got a sham treatment and they came in twice a week and they came in uh for four weeks so this is the treatment period this is the follow-up and you'll see that this is the active group and this is the decrease in um cravings from the baseline so uh it's a ten point scale and and so there's a five point decrease in the ten point scale so they didn't come in at ten they came in let's say seven and they go down to two so it's really a difference between whether you're going to use or not uh if if your craving is two you're not going to use if it's seven you're going to use and and uh so so this is uh these are uh clinically significant uh results uh in my opinion

well especially sorry just especially since we have such a huge issue with opioid abuse and overuse and and overdose deaths I mean we were at they were they were saying 90 000 plus uh deaths related to opioids just in 2020 alone and this is a major problem and there's not a lot of really good treatments to help control brain and again this is just a four-minute light treatment

that's what that's what this uh uh picture is here okay there's no other treatment but photo modulation and and pleasantness we were pleasant but we were pleasant in the sham group and there was a a placebo response you know it went down a point and a half at the follow-up now now the effect size here and here at the week after the last treatment and again we we saw that a week later we got better results than immediately uh I don't know why that is but um uh but uh the difference between here and here and here and here is 1.5 uh the effect size is 1.5 uh a high effect size is eight is is point eight rather so this is twice high and and it's a and the p value is off the chart you know it's all zeros uh and uh so uh again all we did was so I think we could you know go out into the community with a light and and treat people and and and get good results that lasted three weeks um after the treatment and uh we weren't able to do a long-term follow-up we just didn't have a manpower for it

yeah that's hard yeah and um uh and uh just some other things here so uh in in the uh whole active treatment group there was a 70 decrease in uh cravings uh in the sham group there was a uh about a 30 decrease so there was a a healthy placebo effect but it was uh you know half of the uh the treatment effect so the treatment was significantly improved over sham and that shows I think too that you had a good sham it's a really pretty clever just doing everything the exact same just covering the light with foil that's really simple but highly effective

yeah and and and everybody uh uh you know except there were about two patients who did really poorly and and they thought they got the sham that's why how they did you know but but uh most people thought they got the active treatment when when they in fact got the sham and the axis treatment people thought they got the active treatment uh and uh and this just shows the the group comparison and uh and then uh uh the results uh mine light is as a company and uh and we we got uh highly significant results and mclean uh got very similar results we both got down to about minus five uh actually looks like mclean did slightly better uh uh um uh although their sham group did better uh that required for some reason um um and and then uh people on buprenorphine uh uh did well with the treatment so if if someone was on buprenorphine uh with the sham treatment they didn't improve further than what the buprenorphine did but but the uh uh the people who were on buprenorphine uh with the active treatment uh had a uh went down to four so it wasn't you know quite as as as good as the um uh looks like I think this group I think actually went down past five uh to about six um um so that's again it's a ten point scale and if you if you go down six points uh again if you come in at a seven and you go down to a one uh that's remarkable

uh yes in my opinion yes and and uh so I I could see this as an add-on to buprenorphine here uh or a standalone treatment and uh and then this is a drug use and at mclean they got a much better uh decrease in drug use and I think the reason is uh they had more people who were using drugs than we had in my life and and using drug use was not a requirement uh but it turns out that we got significant results with drug use so this is decrease in drug use over the course of the treatment and and uh so these are days of use and and in the sharing group there they tended to be increases uh and uh and this is the same thing with uh the uh uh uh look back uh follow back uh method so this is the days times the amount of use and you see really a healthy uh decrease in use and again it's a sub population because most of the people weren't uh using but it was out of the 39 I think about 14 or so we're using uh uh where it came in using and and uh and and decrease um and uh and this is uh days of uh so the the treated group had uh almost 100 days less of use than a baseline uh whereas the sharing group had nine days less baseline so there was there was a a healthy uh uh improvement in in use as as well as um so these are opiate screens what we found was that the patients often had negative urines um uh when they reported that they had used and I think because there's a lot of fentanyl out there and that didn't show up in the urine test so the findings are based on dual brain psychology and they reinforce uh the dual brain psychology premises which they are that there's a different personality in each hemisphere related to childhood trauma and they show that unilateral transcranial photobiomodulation dramatically reduces opioid cravings and use and it's safe and this doesn't conflict with other medications

yeah we had absolutely no side effects you didn't have a headache or a uh an ache or a pain we had no complaints and I don't have any in my practice um um it's it's uh and it's known to be safe it's not just my uh finding but uh uh and then it was concerned that well what if you put it on the wrong hemisphere you know you make a monster and no you don't uh you you know you you'll bring the person to his regressed state but he's been living in that most of his life and and so it's uh it's it's it's not a a great risk so you know the this is this is a big deal really if you think about the amount of problems we have uh at least here in the u.s with opioid use and cravings and and abuse and and like we mentioned before overdoses so you'd think that a really significant study like this it shows really good effects it's completely safe that is uh you know really naughty it's it's convenient I mean it's a few minutes of a treatment

yeah and it's painless it's pleasant you know uh people feel better with it um uh there it really isn't a negative uh here that I can say you'd think this would be just everywhere like that everybody'd be on board and doing it right I mean that's what it seems like to me uh

right now we're trying to get it through the fda and we have to do another study we have a grant application uh and it's another sbir grant it's a larger grant and if we complete that I think we'll have a good shot at getting fda approval so we don't have fda approval yet and and so we haven't uh uh go into a commercialization phase and we do have a patent one on the unilateral uh and we we have another uh um we had we had some other patent spending and uh so uh uh we're we are we're trying to commercialize it but we we uh uh you know would uh have tried you know to offer it to the city of boston and nobody's called me back I I I've I've made uh you know at least 10 calls at drug clinics and and uh uh halfway houses and stuff and uh um uh maybe it's too weird or something

well you know if you're not familiar with photobiomodulation the idea of you know shining a light onto the brain just it sounds like it's crazy it says it sounds like it's not gonna change um and and maybe I'll say a few words too about the mechanism

yeah so we know a lot about uh uh you know uh chromophores and and atp and and cytochrome c and and mitochondria uh this probably isn't working on that basis it does increase blood flow but that probably is a secondary phenomena I don't think it's the primary phenomenon my uh my guess is that it has to do with changing your mind uh and and for that I think uh we need to be thinking about uh quantum physics and uh uh and so uh I've written about uh brain information and uh and subjective experience and so what we're doing is we're altering subjective experience and uh that comes out of different brain information so I'm sure that the different hemispheres have different brain information uh but what we're doing is we're changing the subjective experience that's associated with that brain information and and uh so I I I think we get into quantum field theory and some stuff that I'm not really qualified to speak upon

well of course me either but this is fascinating stuff um and I think you know you have to have seen I mean not you already mentioned it but you have to have seen your field change so much over the last you know 20 30 years I mean thinking about where we're going to learn what we're going to find out in the next 10 even uh has to be really exciting so it's it's pretty neat to see I think researchers like yourself that are willing to go out on a limb and say I know this is this seems weird but what if we put these concepts together and seeing neat results like this

yeah it's really encouraging to neuroscience and that uh I don't think it's a small area of the brain that consciousness is related to uh and and I don't think that uh I think circuits are involved but they're not the key thing in other words it's uh we have to get back to minds and psychiatry has lost its mind uh and uh we've gotten their drugs in in place of it and and the drugs are not that effective uh you can get half normal with drugs if you're lucky if you don't get worse

wow yeah well doc I appreciate your time today and if you're listening and you want to find out more about the two recent studies that dr schiffer and his team have published you can find those full studies at the links here in the show notes and you can also hear my breakdown of those studies by going back to episode 31 and episode 80. we'll put links in the show notes to that too where I actually run down some of the details directly from the research but you're hearing from the guy himself today and he has a publication we already mentioned it's titled of two minds the second edition just came out you can find that on amazon there will be a link to that book in the show notes as well and then if you're learning about photobiomodulation you want to know more if you're looking for the right type of device for you and your practice if you need assistance with safety and certification training or protocols and settings you can look us up laser therapyinstitute.org we have so many resources available many of them for free and really targeted to the individual in practice but doc I I really again appreciate your time and your attention and your efforts in this really important field do you have anything else you wanted to share with us before we go today

well just to say thank you I've enjoyed speaking with you and and and the opportunity to share my work

well thank you and I look forward to seeing more from you in the near future"
"Dr. Schiffer on PTSD, Addiction, and Advanced Brain Stimulation Methods for Recovery",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p3se6HDzcI,what's really going on in the left and the right side of our brains and how does this thing work I wasn't seeing a lot of IDs and Egos and super egos in my patients but what I was seeing was two different personalities so the person who's talking is in the left brain speech is in the left brain normally when we associate the left and right brain right for example if I am looking to increase my logic and analytical thinking which is governed by my left brain should I cover my left eye and look through the right so it has an opposite response in the brain people are more symptomatic on one side and less symptomatic on the other the emotional side of the brain like flares up or has more activity when you are a bit sleep deprived and your brain is confused on what's going on for the everyday person could that also trigger some sort of a negative experience external events can influence either side all of a sudden the depression anxiety go away and they're business they're all business and and they attend to the problem welcome back to another episode of the shift with CJ podcast where we dive deep into biohacking and psychology neuroscience and these transformative ideas that can actually help you shift your perspective and elevate your life today I am super excited because we have someone whose research has been doing like groundbreaking stuff on how we see the world trauma brain health and so much more our guest on the show today is Dr Frederick Schiffer he is a best-selling author psychologist psychiatrist uh professor at the Harvard Medical School um Dr Schiffer is amazing because he's pioneered what he calls dual brain psychology it's in a way it's a new way of understanding how trauma affects anxiety or how trauma anxiety depression um and all of these things are in two hemispheres of our brain now I will let him explain that even further so without Much Ado please welcome Dr shiffer Dr shiffer how are you today good pleasure to be here thank you for joining us all the way from Boston it's really early for you yeah okay so Dr shipper let's get right into it all your work or most of your work and you the way you're talking about this dual brain psych uh psychology can you explain to us a what does that mean like what's really going on in the left and the right side of our brains and um how does this thing work okay uh so uh it began with early in my career as a psychiatrist I was uh trained at Harvard and uh uh and in psychoanalysis and and uh uh and uh I wasn't seeing a lot of IDs and Egos and super egos in my patients but what I was seeing was two different personalities that when they came in they were sort of id-like they were conscious the ID is supposed to be unconscious and these were conscious people who were immature and impulsive and symptomatic and uh uh and as they got better they became more uh EG likee they more mature wiser healthier and uh then they' regress again and they be back to this immature State and uh uh I didn't quite know what to do with that but I just observed that and then I I was on vacation in England and I was rereading a book about the split brain studies and um and uh and I didn't understand this when I was in college and read them that that the real importance of the split brain studies which are uh studies that took place in in 1940 and then in the 1960s uh in which uh uh people with intractable epilepsy epilepsy that was uh intolerable and uh ruining their lives they couldn't drive they couldn't function couldn't work and uh so uh they did a radical surgery where they cut the connection between the left brain and the right brain and uh and and what they found was that they created two minds they were like two different people and uh I went out to California and did the last split brain study uh and uh this was in in the 1990s and uh and what I did was the first psychological inventory of the two brain hemispheres and and uh I asked uh uh question questions uh of the psychological nature of the two hemispheres and the way I did that that um uh it's known that the eyes are connected to the brain U such that the lateral visual field uh is connected to the opposite brain it it uh uh hits the the light comes in uh say if I show here to the um u u uh uh right uh the left lateral visual field uh it goes U uh if I'm a split brain patient it's only seen by my right brain my right brain is mute uh and so the person who's talking is in the left brain speech is in the left brain so the person says I I can't say it but the U uh individual can take his left hand which is controlled by his right brain and reach into a box and and and pull out the item so say it's a chest piece he and he easily reaches in the box and and pulls out the chest piece if you ask the the um uh left brain to do it with his right hand uh he can't he doesn't know what piece to pick out and and so I put two words on each side of the screen and uh one word might be happy and the other might be dishonest and there were positive and negative words and and we rotated them so that each side got all the words and and what we found was that in this one individual his right brain had a high opinion of himself and he scored high on positive words and low on negative words his his left brain had a low opinion of himself and and um uh scored low on uh positive words and and higher on negative words and and uh and then there was another patient who scored similarly and and the way they scored was the uh there were uh pegs and they used their fingers on each hand and we had graduate students watched their fingers and they pointed to pegs meaning none to extreme and that was the way they answered the questions so the question might be how much do you feel happy or uh how much do you feel uh dishonest and they would answer with their fingers and uh so the the second patient uh scored similarly on both sides but when we were setting up the equipment uh I was talking with him and and asked him about his past and and he said he had been bullied as a child and I said does it bother you he said no it happened so long ago and uh and his right hand which is signing for his left brain which is talking to me um uh indicated that he was not upset by the bullies he answered none for all the I I've inserted about 10 bully questions and but his left hand signing for his right brain indicated that he was extremely upset by the bullies and we published the article and we felt that uh uh that his right brain uh was still upset by the bullies and this is what I see in my practice that old traumas uh like old Soldiers uh Arthur said that they don't die they just fade away and uh uh that old traumas tend to stick around uh without the person being aware of it and uh and that's a lot of what my work is about and uh so uh uh I later discovered a German group that was reporting to show mov these to one brain uh hemisphere the left or right brain um in normal people uh people who had an intact connection between their left and right brain and uh and he was getting different emotional responses and and all the bad responses were not in the right brain where I expected them to be they they were uh mixed and um and and so I decided that he had a million doll machine that track eye movements a massive computer screen and and I didn't understand till I read it about five times what he was doing and I realized he was showing uh the uh movie it was a movie of somebody getting shock treatment so it was a very upsetting movie and uh and uh he was showing it to one lateral visual field with the other and so he was doing what Roger sper who won the no priz did in splp brain patients he showed um images to one lateral visual field or the other and uh so I decided to put my hands up like this and um uh and I I thought I could do the same thing and I then looked over here and I didn't feel any different uh uh but I went to the office of my first patient that day was a a Vietnam veteran who had PTSD who was doing uh much better and I asked him to hold his hands up and he's looking at his um uh left visual field which is stimulating his right brain uh and and he says that plant behind you looks like the jungle so he's he's having a flashback and he's back in Vietnam and so I quickly said well look out the other side and he smiled he said no that's a nice looking plant and that's amazing yeah so I was I was on 2020 with this a number of years ago and um uh and a patient who I hadn't met before uh came to our laboratory and uh we had tape goggles where uh there was tape in the middle and you had to look out one lateral visual field or the other and uh and on one side he felt very relaxed on the other side he got upset and anxious and the moderator from uh ABC news said well what are you feeling and he said I feel like going to war and uh uh and this is typical I say this in about 55% of patients in my practice and another 30% have differences but they're not so dramatic they feel more relaxed on one side uh and and the side that that is better uh it tends to be a trade it tends to stay that way for their uh duration sometimes it switches but usually 95% of the time is the same and then about 15% of PE people didn't have any difference between their sides that is fascinating that is so fascinating uh and so I have what I call dual brainy therapy where I talk with two people in one brain and and and I I use special sunglasses that I developed uh that stimulate uh one uh let more light in one lateral visual field than the other and we also have uh an FM now an FM is a uh everybody knows what an MRI machine is and an fmri has special software that measures blood flow in the brain and blood flow is an index of brain activity the more activity the more the blood flows to that uh side or that area of the brain and and ephemeris are used in Neuroscience uh but they don't really reveal much generally over the decades that they've been used they usually present kind of a measles picture and it's hard to interpret but in my study uh when people look to the left visual field for 30 seconds and then the right visual field then repeated it and then when we took seven people who were in the study and crunched the data the uh when they looked to the left the right brain had a a massive increase in in blood flow compared to the other side the other side looked relatively dark AR like a blackout and then when they just looked out the other visual field uh the opposite brain lit up and so with this simple technique um uh I I I I graduated to um using an envelope so if if I cover one eye in the middle of the other eye I I can stimulate uh the uh opposite brain hem spere and if you want to try this uh we can see if if you have a response or not do you have an envelop handy I I don't have an envelope but I have a book if that works but before that I wanted to I wanted to ask you one thing so normally when we associate the left and right brain right so a lot of people know that the left brain is associated more more with logic language analytical thinking and the right is more creative intuitive um and more emotional so if I for example if I I am looking to increase my um logic and analytical thinking which is governed by my left brain should I cover my left eye and look through the right so it has an opposite response in the brain uh I don't find that to happen Okay so so what what I find is uh that people are more symptomatic on one side and less symptomatic on the other and they can speak uh no matter which visual field is blocked uh or or they're looking out and they can move both sides of their body so we know that neurologically uh if someone has a stroke in their right brain they get paralyzed uh on their left side and um uh that if if they have a stroke in their left brain that's for speeches uh they become a phasic and they can't uh uh uh speak or if it depending on the area of the speech center they can't understand language and uh so um so uh motor systems and uh Speech systems uh are are definitely lateralized but this what we're doing doesn't affect that other words this is a different property and uh and so the left brain uh may be more logical uh so you have to uh cover one eye in the middle of the other eye okay so I covering one eye and the middle of the other eye with this book or people who were looking at this on video Yeah and and so I want you to think of something upsetting upsetting okay yeah and and I want you to measure say how much distress you feel from 0 to 10 um not so much to be honest like normally I would be more stressful uh so would you say one or two or nothing um I would say between two to three okay now I want you do the same thing looking at the other side okay now I'm switching my book to the other side covering this eye and thinking about the same situation the other eye half your left eye cover half your left ey okay okay okay okay good and think about the same situation the same upsetting thing now I don't know if this is Placebo or not but what I feel is on the left eye I feel more um emotional yeah um so basically I was thinking about just so people who are listening or watching this have a context I have a dog and I love dogs and I was imagining someone killing a dog on purpose so this is something that is very disgusting and I wouldn't stand it and I would generally be upset either angry or sad or one of those emotions when I covered my left eye and I was looking at it from the right eye it did not trigger me as much as I would think it would but when I covered my right eye and I was looking at it from my left eye it did Spike up an emotion I wouldn't say so much but again we're in a recording podcast so maybe what would you say from zero to 10 um zero to 10 I would say more so um two on the lowest from the right and maybe five on the left well that's a big difference okay so that's more than 100 it was noticeable yeah it's noticeable and and this would change if like for example if I was imagining something of something horrible that happened in my past you mentioned bullying before I was obese as a kid I was bullied as a kid and I also think that you know you mention you mentioned the work trauma and from the work that I read of yours like trauma is also emphasized it could be PTSD or something else but I think um most of the people especially in this part of the world they associate trauma with something big like a terrible accident or they lose someone but um you talk about trauma in many different ways it doesn't have to be the trauma with the capital T it could be small everyday things like bullying which happened when I was in school um I'm talking about like 20 years ago and probably if you ask me now it doesn't affect me so much but did it do at that point yeah a lot now I I wonder if you do that visual thing again and think about the bullying see if it does bother you more on one side than the other so you're looking at your I'm looking out of my right eye fi yeah so it's it's actually not your right eye but your right lateral visual field okay right A lot of people look at the whole eye and that goes to both hemispheres and you don't get a response oh okay so you're looking exactly at the half right okay yeah exactly half yeah okay so and and think about the bully did you have any reaction a bit but not so much so how would you score it from um again I would I would not score at more than three okay and yeah and think about the bullying don't strange it's strange this time I'm not I'm not having a big reaction on my left side it's um if that was three this would be like one uhuh okay but I'm but also I'm so excited to talk to you I don't know if the excitement is changing okay well usually I would expect it to be much higher on on on one side and and it can be either side that that has the negative thing and and and it's I call it what my first book is called of two minds and and what I mean by that is that if someone is um uh uh having a conversation with me uh looking out uh one side say they're troubled sign uh I'll look uh critical like maybe their mother was and that might be a trauma as as you point out that that I I think that U uh severe uh uh you know having an alcoholic father who beats mother and and throws the kid down the stairs repeat I had that okay okay we're going to do many experiments later yeah well that's serious and uh uh but uh but you may not have that in mind in other words that that you may be thinking you know what happened a long time ago and it's not important but that's pretty severe a lot of times it's it's not even that severe it's more uh maybe a distant father who's not very uh involved and and uh is sort of rejecting or a mother I have a lot of men whose mother said oh you're a loser when they came criticizing them yeah criticizing them or with friends or like your teacher or someone who didn't see you in the right light and that kind of stays with a lot of people I meet so many people who say every time you remind them of an emotion that kind of happened in their childhood and they're like oh my God I cannot like you know they they start shaking sometimes so those memories can be really strong yes or they get angry what happens but what happens with that early trauma is uh that you go to school and it's harder to concentrate and then the teacher gets angry with you and so the the trauma then snowballs and then and maybe uh uh peers uh are getting critical because you're not doing well in the athletic field or or or in the classroom and so you wind up making friends with other people who are having trouble and then uh when when a person gets to be an adolescent they they start skipping school or drinking or uh uh and then uh might fail out of college and and each of these things is a great trauma and and if they become uh addicted uh then that's a great trauma they feel that they're an addict and and I like to say I don't have any addicts in my practice I have trauma victims and and that the addiction is an attempt by the immature side to deal with the trauma and and the immature side almost always picks uh solutions that uh uh bring on more trauma and and and and more distress and uh uh that uh when I see people in my practice they're often uh using drugs and and and they're it might be homeless or uh uh and feel really uh that their lives are failed and they have no idea that they have a healthy part to them and uh uh and uh we can elicit that uh with the envelope we can uh and I also have uh another way of stimulating the hemisphere and right now we're doing a a$2 and5 million uh NIH brand is this the LED lights yeah yeah it's an LED that we developed at MGH and we put it over the forehead um on one side say my uh left brain is my positive hemosphere and uh and it's it's just a 4minute treatment and the FDA has determined that has no significant risk and we haven't seen any uh side effects from it and uh can you talk to us about how it works like so basically it's a light that goes on the forehead and is the the light pulsating at a certain frequency or it's like uh moving the blood flow into a certain part of the brain maybe The Logical Center or the emotional Center or an area that needs some help um uh the light goes and the reason we picked it is near Red Light it goes through the skull oh no way yeah and and uh and it's called photobiomodulation and and it does a lot of good things to the brain uh but I don't think that's what I'm doing in other words it stimulates energy production decreases inflammation increases blood flow it it does a lot of um uh uh good things to the brain and it doesn't do anything that is known to be harmful to the brain uh it's interesting because I don't know if you know this but I have um at one of my companies bioh Haagen we are we have photo modulation products and we developed yeah we developed a cap with red and near infrared light but these are the the LED lights are placed at certain parts different areas of the brain it's designed to stimulate the brain and um do some sort of a brain wave entrainment where we can teach the brain slowly on go how to go into like you know 10 HZ frequency or like a 40 HZ gamma brain w frequency but I did not know these LED lights were like uh near infrared the ones we use is for red and near infrared um it was developed for like athletes and people who are like Executives but most of the people now use it for hair loss because it has a it's got an effect on increasing the blood flow on the hair follicles and then it stimulates hair growth this is fascinating I did not know this yes uh now but you're you're simulating both sides and and and uh so what I do is simulate one side and um and and in this grant we're treating fentanyl addiction and it's our third clinical trial and uh and we we uh in our first two trials got uh uh great results and so the FDA has given us a breakthrough designation and and uh and that's why we have this big Grant from it's from NIH the National Institute for drug abuse congratulations and um uh and uh half the people are getting a sham treatment uh and I don't know who's getting active in sham but I do know that uh if I rank the people according to uh how much they've decreased or fentanyl the top half uh have an 80% decrease in Fentanyl and a lot of them have stopped their fentanyl the bottom half have a 16% decrease and and some of them have have gotten worse uh and so they may be getting the I I'm hoping that the bottom half are getting sham and the top half are getting active treatment uh uh and I think that that's probably true because it's hard to treat a fentanyl with a poo yeah I would I would ask you like what is what do you think is the mechanism of action there is it that okay so what I think again I mentioned that there are known to be a lot of good things that happen with the brain but not in four minutes okay so someone can get a four minute treatment and uh and you'll notice the when we did the ey uh maneuver uh that takes place in seconds so so your response was um uh with within a few seconds and um uh with the light uh we give a 4minute treatment usually the person feels the difference in about 2 and a half minutes so and it's a special light that we developed it's very intense it's um uh 240 mowatt per cm squared and so so your lights are probably uh 10 m or something that and uh um and it's in a it's in one location and so it's concentrated so yeah so we're trying to simulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex so we put it over that and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a hub uh for the brain it's an association area and uh I'm trying to stimulate a mind so uh so I think that what what I'm doing is having actually a Quantum effect now I don't know that but I think that um uh uh that I think I'm stimulating uh brain information that becomes conscious and and that creates a conscious mind that has a different body of information it's a more positive body of information and I'm able to make it conscious if I put the light on the other side just like with the visual thing uh the the person will have a more negative uh Outlook and and uh uh uh they won't go into a catastrophe if you put it on the negative side but they'll have their symptoms that they came in with does everyone have a different negative and a positive side or is it standard for everyone it's pretty standard in terms of what I've seen over decades that that um uh that rather than uh it it being more logical or more artistic uh it's more uh uh symptomatic and neurotic uh versus healthy and sensible and and um uh I had an experience where it was the first time I was about 5 years after I wrote my first book and I was on a vacation in Italy and my wife was driving and we had a 5-Hour drive to an apartment that we rented and uh and I I was feeling uncomfortable my wife is a good driver and she was driving and and uh and I felt like we were going to have an accident and I and I noticed after about an hour that the road was really safe it was like any road uh uh uh you know in in in the US that I drive one and um and then after a while uh I decided to put my hands up and block my vision and I was looking out my uh right lateral visual field which would stimulate my left brain and all of that anxiety went away just immediately and I looked out the other side and I got a Vavoom of anxiety and then we got to the the apartment and it had a balcony uh looking at over a road so I'm up on a balcony uh and and if I look out my uh right um uh my left uh um um um Lal Vision if I looked at my my left lateral visual field simulating my right brain uh I got very anxious and so they that I'm looking at cars on the on a road it was a it wasn't a highway it was a a back road but it was uh and I felt like the cars were sort of going to jump up and hit me and and I said well that's crazy you know and and I looked out the other side and felt perfectly safe and it was a normal Road and and uh and I had to wrestle with myself for about a day I said do I want to ruin the vacation I want to be crazy orane and and uh uh and I was able to Prevail but it with all my experience and you know writing a book and and and and it turned out I realized a few years later not at that time that it had to do with some trauma that I had experienced that being in Italy brought up and and um um and so that was the first time that I had experienced uh the the lateral visual effect and and I use it now if if I'm under stress I can get an envelope and look out and I use the uh light uh on most days I try and use it every day sometimes I I'll miss a day and I think it's good for cognitive enhancement and uh that's so interesting could it were you um were you at any point when this this thing was happening this episodes of feeling scared or nervous or anxiety yeah um was your sleep the same as it is all the time CU here here's something that I'm thinking I have experienced something similar especially but I've made some long travels but one of the things that I also think is that sometimes I cannot sleep on the airplane then there is jet lag and you know then we know that the emotional side of the brain like flares up or has more activity when you are a bit sleep deprived and your brain is confused on what's going on and could for the everyday person could that also trigger something some sort of a negative experience yeah that's absolutely true uh there was a movie with Steve Martin and Lilly Tomlin I do you know who they are no but I will look them up uh uh well Steve Martin is a a comedian and he he's in the US uh he he's sort of retired now but but he he was um at the height of his um uh popularity and was very famous and and uh and Lily Tomlin was also a comedian uh and uh so the story is that Lily Tomlin is meditating with her Guru and there's a terrible accident that the humming bow slips out of the guru's hands and tumbles down a a a huge flight of stairs in Manhattan and as a result l tomlin's mind gets embedded in Steve Martin's brain and and uh so you have uh Steve Martin in as the embodiment and Billy Tomlin wants to go downtown and Steve Martin wants to go uptown so he's going like this back and forth and she's screaming at him you know she wants to go here and he's trying to resist now if someone came by and and encouraged Lily Tomlin uh and then uh she would have gotten stronger and so if if something encourages the negative side say that you know someone is inducing somebody to use fentanyl that that'll arouse the negative side and it actually becomes stronger and uh so if Lily Tomlin was yelling loud enough she might have gotten her way and G downtown uh that the two sides can compete and they often when a patient comes in the two sides are often fighting and trying to kill each other or or they they don't acknowledge each other they and and what I do in dual brain Psychotherapy is to get them to cooperate and and to treat the trauma uh in the troubl side and use the healthy side as a co-therapist to help treat the trauma so uh you I think that you're right that um uh that uh external events can influence either side in other words If U uh uh let's say somebody wakes up and they're anxious and depressed and they get a phone call from work and there's a problem that they have to solve all of a sudden the depression anxiety go away and their business they're all business and and they attend to the problem the brain shifts the focus yeah yeah it it'll strengthen the mature side it'll Rouse the mature side so that these two minds are influenced by outside events and influenced by each other and uh that I'll teach the patient how to talk with the uh the troubl side and and he can influence it and and um and the troubled side often batters and and abuses the the healthy side now just because you mentioned the guru and meditation I wanted to bring up another thing like in the Eastern I'm originally from India and in the Eastern philosophy especially when it comes to yoga and yogis culture they have um they have a similar idea they talk about two sorts of like energy channels in the body which Al goes up to the brain which is the feminine side is Ida which is more creative more lunar energy you'll hear all these things in like the these are the terminologies and the male style is more masculine more logical and the goal is that these two are always fluctuating no one has like a complete balance like if you're a guru you probably have like a complete balance uh where there's a center point but in almost all of us there are these opposite Yin and yangs that are working all the time and and uh one could in certain situations get more agitated can be more anxiety prone and this is what we see today like you mentioned you know external events like even having substances like uh having two cups of coffee instead of one or you know just um looking at your screen for long amounts of time with the blue light and how it messes the Circadian rhythm and then there's a downstream effect on different things but you said something even interesting the two sides of the brain I I can't remember from who but years ago I read that yes of course you have these different sides of the brain and it also helps if you name them if you name um you know like my name is CJ and I would say cj1 or cj2 just for Simplicity and this is when you know that cj1 as in this part of your brain is becoming more dominant right now and while you while you don't get involved in the emotion this allows you to take a step back and observe the different parts of their brain and how they're communicating with each other so one part is being nasty or trying to kind of like sabotage the other one you could just say hey cj1 I see what you're doing like you know I want you know you some I don't know if it makes sense but it kind of like helps you even better than being a victim of the situation and saying like I'm I'm so stress thrown and my day isn't getting good if you take a step back and you say okay this part of my brain seems a bit overactive right now can I you know with meditation or just by talking or you know covering one eye can I influence one of these what's your thought on that uh yes I I agree with you and and uh and I have Fred and Freddy uh okay good and and most of my patients you know I have two names you know usually you know their their regular name and and I put an ie you know uh uh to for a dimin uh term for the the child more I don't like the term in a child because I think it's overused and and and and kind of um uh devalued uh uh but but it is but what I'm talking about is an inner child and um U and and I think to give them two different names I think is is a is a reality they're two different people and and uh and I think it makes it easier to talk to them and so I'll have a conversation with Freddy and and uh um and it might be 3:00 in the morning you know if I wake up and I I get downstairs and and get a snack and I sit down and talk to Freddy and and uh uh and during the day um uh uh you know Fred needs to be in charge the light treatment stimulate the mature side and um and and the envelope can help in that regard yeah the envelope is really good it's it gives Everyday People access because if someone is listening to this or someone is um looking at at us on video that is such a lwh hanging fruit that everyone can do no matter where they are and they don't have to have access to sophisticated technology of course the technology is so much more faster and has much more results but let's say someone's just having a bad day and you know if they have the power to just choose something like you know I had that book right here where I had my notes and if they could do it right in the moment it's a good thing for them because like like you said the snowballing effect we don't realize it but for the average person uh you know their boss is stress stressing them out then they have a stress out day they miss the gym they eat junk then they go have a fight with their partner then they have a fight with their kids kids are angry kids develop trauma so this is like it starts off with the smallest thing and if we give people the opportunity or the knowledge and I'm so grateful that you're putting all of this great work out there that yeah you can use Advanced things but like start off with the simple thing it's and also I have my book that I'm I put up here to my book U uh this this just came out this is my shout out everyone please check out uh it's called the goodbye anxiety uh depression addiction PTSD the life-changing science of dual brain psychology and it's an easy read uh uh so a lot of people might be intimidated uh uh by um um a book you know that has to do with science and but the science is is presented in a very easy to understand way and uh and there there's a chapter on self-help and and uh oh that's good and and their narrative fictional descriptions of actual therapy sessions um and and U uh so people tell me that it's an easy read that's good we will put the link in the show notes so everyone who can buy it they can buy it from us or anywhere internationally now I want to ask you a question you've been I mean you've been with Harvard for such a long time and we know like really interesting things come out of there are they working on something secretive or like not secretive let's say like do you know about like projects studies devices that have been developed right now that could change the way our mental health is in the future I know that they're doing a lot of things in longevity and uh you know the future of biology psychology um and Neuroscience and all of these things combined so do you know of anything that is exciting for you uh don't okay I think I think that um uh when I started at mlan it was a psychoanalytic Bastion you you can't find a psychoanalyst at mlan anymore or any any respectable hospital it's all drugs and insurance and people come in uh they they hardly get talked to and they just get put on medications and then discharged quickly and uh and I I I find that the state of psychiat today is very toxic and I think that Neuroscience uh has not resulted in in much knowledge uh or uh and or Therapeutics uh you know that there there is ketamine and there are Psych uh uh and and there uh the these might pan out to be um uh important developments but they seem to have uh problems and and uh um um I I I don't know that they're going to revolutionize the treatment of Psychiatry so but a lot of people are using it now right like MDMA I know John Hopkins is doing a lot of research with uh MDA assisted Psychotherapy and then of course ketamine um I've even heard some stories about like DMT uh administers straight and looking at like how the regions of the brain are changing or how people's subjective experiences are changing under the same um modality yes and and I don't know um uh of research at mlan I mean it might be going on but I don't know about it with using these substances MH and um uh so uh uh to answer your question I I not that I'm aware of okay in terms of some secret breakthrough okay cool um let's talk about something else you know Elon Musk has been talking about like putting a chip into people's brain he calls it the neuralink what do you think about that do you think uh there is any efficacy of this or do you think in the future sure like for example instead of using the LED lights or using the envelope we could just plant a chip in our brain and then have like our iPhone as a remote controller and say okay stimulate Freddy now and stimulate Fred now do you think the future could look like this um you know I don't I really don't know how the chip would operate you know so the chip would would I assume have some intelligence to it and and uh uh and uh there there is a modality called transcranial direct electral simulation I've done that and and U and if you uh the one side stimulates and the other side inhibits if you put it on front and and uh and that's been used to treat depression and and usually they'll stimulate the left side and and try and inhibit the right side and so you can sort of use electricity to stimulate uh you probably could use electrical Fields uh now uh we did some interesting studies with rtms so rtms uses a a magnetic field that causes a current in the brain MH and and for some reason that's unknown they all they only want to stimulate the left side the idea that uh left is good and right is bad uh is is kind of grounded in in in Psychology and Neuroscience um so I we did two studies uh to uh that what we find is about that there probably is more people who have a positive left brain but particularly in people with severe PTSD they're lot lot of times their left brain is their negative side and so um uh I would say generally but it's about 6040 the split and so you have to test people individually with to see which side is their positive side and their negative side so we did this with a group uh who were getting TMS which is a trans Grom magnetic stimulation it's a treatment for depression and uh and what we found was that if somebody had a negative left hemisphere uh they didn't do well with TMS if their left brain were were their positive side they did well and and we repeated this uh and and and got the same results with a uh one study was at Harvard uh with a uh at Bethal Hospital a different facility and I didn't run the study I just lent them uh uh the glasses to test the Baseline uh hemispheric balance and and the other study was done in Canada but we got the the same results and also there were gender differences that were matched and and uh uh uh so what what we found was that if you stimulate with the magnet uh a negative left brain uh you're not going to get a good result and the results with TMS are are mediocre uh and um uh that we we had much higher result in people with the Positive left brain who were getting their left brain stimulated and I tried to convince people uh to uh stimulate the right side in in those people who have uh their right side as their positive brain and no one would do it and that's how I got interested in the in the photobiomodulation I wanted something to stimulate the hemisphere more powerfully I I didn't have to Lug up three flights of stairs with a heavy machine and uh uh and it turned out that it it worked beyond our wildest expectations that's amazing if you ever come to Dubai just bring it with you and we can test it with a lot of people over here I'm sure we have a lot of guinea pigs who will say I want to test it and see how it works we have a huge community of biohackers and you know held people here this is so fascinating you know I have a headset um which is an American company is called um blank out on the name I need some brain stimulation but um the idea is that they have a visor which it which has LED lights and this LED lights are flickering in a certain way um which can get you into the Alpha Brain wve State they have a headphone which has lights which are going into the ear canal Lo light um at 450 nanom and red light at 660 nanom and they're using Chinese Meridian and acupuncture points to get a signal into the brain the headsets itself has different kind of isochronic tones um binaural beads and a lot of these other kind of sound Technologies but the most interesting thing that I found was that they found a way to let's say let's to keep it simple they found a way to induce three sets of sounds at the same time so one is coming from the left ear one is coming from the right ear and then there is a subconscious programming message going on which could be self-help or you know talking about your traumas and how you can release them but the immediate effect of all these stimulation going in your brain is that if you lie down with lights closed it'll take you to that Delta brain wave state where you're just you feel like you're sleeping but you're not really sleeping and then the program is going on for like 25 minutes by the end of the program you wake up if you if you really went to sleep you don't remember what's going on but your subconscious mind registers it and the more often you do it then you have a change in your behavior your perspective your way of thinking just because the sounds are going through different um you know different ear passages and they say that they are stimulating different parts of the brain uh yes I think sound does cross over and and it's not as powerful uh neurologic connection as the eyes but but the ears are connected to the opposite brain uh and um um and so I I think that's really interesting I'm not aware of that technology and and it might be that if they did a baseline uh test with with the uh envelope uh that they might reverse uh uh the earphones and and uh and some individuals and and and improve their results I don't know that just a suggestion I would I would be excited to see like your LED lights with uh transcranial direct simulation with the headphones with like you know a biohacker tech which goes through maybe in the next two to three years or the next five years which goes through all of the different entry points and then you know has different mechanisms of action and like gets us into an altered state or like a state which is preferable um yeah so I'm excited about that hopefully that happens sometime soon I have a patent pending uh on a device that uses music and and I I play caling music uh opposite the uh troubled side and uh so it's not as sophisticated as what you're describing uh but uh but I I have you know been you know playing around a little bit with sound but um uh um um but you know what what you're describing is interesting and and I'll email you the link of the device they're really big yeah I'll do that okay um Dr shiffer this has been super exciting thank you so much for your time we have covered so many things and I think people have like a better idea on um what dual brain psychology is if you don't please read the book I'm also going to link to his website and some of the other things so you can take a deeper read but before I let let you go is there anything that you want to share any you know tips practical stuff what you want people to see what you want people to do anything the floor is yours uh I think that the real breakthrough occurs when you teach uh in other words not tell the the the trouble side but get the trouble side to think and and say uh do do you think that you really were a bad child uh and and and get to sort of have a Socratic discussion with it and when the when the uh little boy or little girl is able to go aha I'm really not bad uh I really don't need to fear the bullies uh that's when uh the person really gets better okay interesting thank you so much thank you so much for all the good work that you're doing thank you for giving us your time thank you for getting on the podcast so early before I let you go my last question to you is if you could reverse time let's say we made a technology developed and we put you into a time capsule you could go back to younger self but only for like 30 seconds and you could give back your younger self one piece of advice what would that be uh well I I I I don't know I think things have played out it's just taken too long you know that that so that uh uh you know I'm uh in my 80s now you know and and uh and I have so much more work to do and uh uh so you know I wish all this happened faster but it takes time to make discoveries and and and uh especially if you're discovering something that is sounds strange and it's hard to get other people uh to um join in the the other thing that I think happens is there's a line from Shakespeare that says uh there is a tide in the Affairs of men which Shen at the flood leads on the fortune and and uh uh and I think if I were researching drugs in in in the 1980s it would have been easy to promote myself uh and and promote what I was doing uh but this this you know is not supported by any outside flow I'm the only person working on the hemispheres and and and you know I have colleagues at mlan who work with me uh uh uh and the NIH has been good to me um uh but um uh and also the US Army is uh applying for a very large Grant to treat to depression and combat PTSD with my light and and uh so but but there hasn't been really a stream of of I'm I'm always swimming Upstream okay but I don't know how to answer the question except that I I think um uh things have worked out well for me and it's just a life you know takes time and has its obstacles I guess I then the lesson that we can share with everyone is of patience and persistence and believing in what you do because yes you're right it takes time um whenever we hear stories of others we always hear like how fast things have happened but we don't see those countless million stories which were either unsuccessful they never got to the place or it took too much time because we always romanticizing the idea of things becoming fast and instant gratification a good way to think about is like if you want a child like you know you can you can make someone pregnant but it still takes nine it still take nine months you cannot sleep with nine people and expect you know the baby in a month nature and some some things have its own time and the faster you understand it and are peace with it at least you won't stimulate the other side of your brain how about that how about we close with that lesson good okay yeah it's been a pleasure thank you thank you this has been pleasure for me as well and this is CJ everyone your host your friend signing out of the ship for CJ podcast everyone have an amazing day amazing week Amazing Life find a book find an envelope try to do this experiment read his book and remember good things in life will take time be patient this is me signing out of the shipit CJ podcast take care everyone [Music],"what's really going on in the left and the right side of our brains and how does this thing work I wasn't seeing a lot of IDs and Egos and super egos in my patients but what I was seeing was two different personalities so the person who's talking is in the left brain speech is in the left brain normally when we associate the left and right brain right for example if I am looking to increase my logic and analytical thinking which is governed by my left brain should I cover my left eye and look through the right so it has an opposite response in the brain people are more symptomatic on one side and less symptomatic on the other the emotional side of the brain like flares up or has more activity when you are a bit sleep deprived and your brain is confused on what's going on for the everyday person could that also trigger some sort of a negative experience external events can influence either side all of a sudden the depression anxiety go away and they're business they're all business and and they attend to the problem

welcome back to another episode of the shift with CJ podcast where we dive deep into biohacking and psychology neuroscience and these transformative ideas that can actually help you shift your perspective and elevate your life today I am super excited because we have someone whose research has been doing like groundbreaking stuff on how we see the world trauma brain health and so much more

our guest on the show today is Dr Frederick Schiffer he is a best-selling author psychologist psychiatrist uh professor at the Harvard Medical School um Dr Schiffer is amazing because he's pioneered what he calls dual brain psychology it's in a way it's a new way of understanding how trauma affects anxiety or how trauma anxiety depression um and all of these things are in two hemispheres of our brain now I will let him explain that even further so without Much Ado please welcome Dr shiffer Dr shiffer how are you today

good pleasure to be here thank you for joining us all the way from Boston it's really early for you yeah

okay so Dr shipper let's get right into it all your work or most of your work and you the way you're talking about this dual brain psych uh psychology can you explain to us a what does that mean like what's really going on in the left and the right side of our brains and um how does this thing work

okay uh so uh it began with early in my career as a psychiatrist I was uh trained at Harvard and uh uh and in psychoanalysis and and uh uh and uh I wasn't seeing a lot of IDs and Egos and super egos in my patients but what I was seeing was two different personalities that when they came in they were sort of id-like they were conscious the ID is supposed to be unconscious and these were conscious people who were immature and impulsive and symptomatic and uh uh and as they got better they became more uh EG likee they more mature wiser healthier and uh then they' regress again and they be back to this immature State and uh uh I didn't quite know what to do with that but I just observed that and then I I was on vacation in England and I was rereading a book about the split brain studies and um and uh and I didn't understand this when I was in college and read them that that the real importance of the split brain studies which are uh studies that took place in in 1940 and then in the 1960s uh in which uh uh people with intractable epilepsy epilepsy that was uh intolerable and uh ruining their lives they couldn't drive they couldn't function couldn't work and uh so uh they did a radical surgery where they cut the connection between the left brain and the right brain and uh and and what they found was that they created two minds they were like two different people

and uh I went out to California and did the last split brain study uh and uh this was in in the 1990s and uh and what I did was the first psychological inventory of the two brain hemispheres and and uh I asked uh uh question questions uh of the psychological nature of the two hemispheres and the way I did that that um uh it's known that the eyes are connected to the brain U such that the lateral visual field uh is connected to the opposite brain it it uh uh hits the the light comes in uh say if I show here to the um u u uh uh right uh the left lateral visual field uh it goes U uh if I'm a split brain patient it's only seen by my right brain my right brain is mute uh and so the person who's talking is in the left brain speech is in the left brain so the person says I I can't say it but the U uh individual can take his left hand which is controlled by his right brain and reach into a box and and and pull out the item so say it's a chest piece he and he easily reaches in the box and and pulls out the chest piece if you ask the the um uh left brain to do it with his right hand uh he can't he doesn't know what piece to pick out and and so I put two words on each side of the screen and uh one word might be happy and the other might be dishonest and there were positive and negative words and and we rotated them so that each side got all the words and and what we found was that in this one individual his right brain had a high opinion of himself and he scored high on positive words and low on negative words his his left brain had a low opinion of himself and and um uh scored low on uh positive words and and higher on negative words and and uh and then there was another patient who scored similarly and and the way they scored was the uh there were uh pegs and they used their fingers on each hand and we had graduate students watched their fingers and they pointed to pegs meaning none to extreme and that was the way they answered the questions so the question might be how much do you feel happy or uh how much do you feel uh dishonest and they would answer with their fingers

and uh so the the second patient uh scored similarly on both sides but when we were setting up the equipment uh I was talking with him and and asked him about his past and and he said he had been bullied as a child and I said does it bother you he said no it happened so long ago and uh and his right hand which is signing for his left brain which is talking to me um uh indicated that he was not upset by the bullies he answered none for all the I I've inserted about 10 bully questions and but his left hand signing for his right brain indicated that he was extremely upset by the bullies and we published the article and we felt that uh uh that his right brain uh was still upset by the bullies and this is what I see in my practice that old traumas uh like old Soldiers uh Arthur said that they don't die they just fade away and uh uh that old traumas tend to stick around uh without the person being aware of it and uh and that's a lot of what my work is about

and uh so uh uh I later discovered a German group that was reporting to show mov these to one brain uh hemisphere the left or right brain um in normal people uh people who had an intact connection between their left and right brain and uh and he was getting different emotional responses and and all the bad responses were not in the right brain where I expected them to be they they were uh mixed and um and and so I decided that he had a million doll machine that track eye movements a massive computer screen and and I didn't understand till I read it about five times what he was doing and I realized he was showing uh the uh movie it was a movie of somebody getting shock treatment so it was a very upsetting movie and uh and uh he was showing it to one lateral visual field with the other and so he was doing what Roger sper who won the no priz did in splp brain patients he showed um images to one lateral visual field or the other and uh so I decided to put my hands up like this and um uh and I I thought I could do the same thing and I then looked over here and I didn't feel any different uh uh but I went to the office of my first patient that day was a a Vietnam veteran who had PTSD who was doing uh much better and I asked him to hold his hands up and he's looking at his um uh left visual field which is stimulating his right brain uh and and he says that plant behind you looks like the jungle so he's he's having a flashback and he's back in Vietnam and so I quickly said well look out the other side and he smiled he said no that's a nice looking plant and that's amazing

yeah so I was I was on 2020 with this a number of years ago and um uh and a patient who I hadn't met before uh came to our laboratory and uh we had tape goggles where uh there was tape in the middle and you had to look out one lateral visual field or the other and uh and on one side he felt very relaxed on the other side he got upset and anxious and the moderator from uh ABC news said well what are you feeling and he said I feel like going to war and uh uh and this is typical I say this in about 55% of patients in my practice and another 30% have differences but they're not so dramatic they feel more relaxed on one side uh and and the side that that is better uh it tends to be a trade it tends to stay that way for their uh duration sometimes it switches but usually 95% of the time is the same and then about 15% of PE people didn't have any difference between their sides that is fascinating that is so fascinating

uh and so I have what I call dual brainy therapy where I talk with two people in one brain and and and I I use special sunglasses that I developed uh that stimulate uh one uh let more light in one lateral visual field than the other and we also have uh an FM now an FM is a uh everybody knows what an MRI machine is and an fmri has special software that measures blood flow in the brain and blood flow is an index of brain activity the more activity the more the blood flows to that uh side or that area of the brain and and ephemeris are used in Neuroscience uh but they don't really reveal much generally over the decades that they've been used they usually present kind of a measles picture and it's hard to interpret but in my study uh when people look to the left visual field for 30 seconds and then the right visual field then repeated it and then when we took seven people who were in the study and crunched the data the uh when they looked to the left the right brain had a a massive increase in in blood flow compared to the other side the other side looked relatively dark AR like a blackout and then when they just looked out the other visual field uh the opposite brain lit up and so with this simple technique um uh I I I I graduated to um using an envelope so if if I cover one eye in the middle of the other eye I I can stimulate uh the uh opposite brain hem spere and if you want to try this uh we can see if if you have a response or not do you have an envelop handy

I don't have an envelope but I have a book if that works but before that I wanted to I wanted to ask you one thing so normally when we associate the left and right brain right so a lot of people know that the left brain is associated more more with logic language analytical thinking and the right is more creative intuitive um and more emotional so if I for example if I I am looking to increase my um logic and analytical thinking which is governed by my left brain should I cover my left eye and look through the right so it has an opposite response in the brain

uh I don't find that to happen Okay so so what what I find is uh that people are more symptomatic on one side and less symptomatic on the other and they can speak uh no matter which visual field is blocked uh or or they're looking out and they can move both sides of their body so we know that neurologically uh if someone has a stroke in their right brain they get paralyzed uh on their left side and um uh that if if they have a stroke in their left brain that's for speeches uh they become a phasic and they can't uh uh uh speak or if it depending on the area of the speech center they can't understand language and uh so um so uh motor systems and uh Speech systems uh are are definitely lateralized but this what we're doing doesn't affect that other words this is a different property and uh and so the left brain uh may be more logical uh so you have to uh cover one eye in the middle of the other eye

okay so I covering one eye and the middle of the other eye with this book or people who were looking at this on video

Yeah and and so I want you to think of something upsetting

upsetting okay yeah and and I want you to measure say how much distress you feel from 0 to 10

um not so much to be honest like normally I would be more stressful

uh so would you say one or two or nothing

um I would say between two to three

okay now I want you do the same thing looking at the other side

okay now I'm switching my book to the other side covering this eye and thinking about the same situation the other eye

half your left eye cover half your left ey

okay okay okay okay good and think about the same situation the same upsetting thing

now I don't know if this is Placebo or not but what I feel is on the left eye I feel more um emotional yeah um so basically I was thinking about just so people who are listening or watching this have a context I have a dog and I love dogs and I was imagining someone killing a dog on purpose so this is something that is very disgusting and I wouldn't stand it and I would generally be upset either angry or sad or one of those emotions when I covered my left eye and I was looking at it from the right eye it did not trigger me as much as I would think it would but when I covered my right eye and I was looking at it from my left eye it did Spike up an emotion I wouldn't say so much but again we're in a recording podcast so maybe what would you say from zero to 10

um zero to 10 I would say more so um two on the lowest from the right and maybe five on the left

well that's a big difference okay so that's more than 100

it was noticeable

yeah it's noticeable and and this would change if like for example if I was imagining something of something horrible that happened in my past you mentioned bullying before I was obese as a kid I was bullied as a kid and I also think that you know you mention you mentioned the work trauma and from the work that I read of yours like trauma is also emphasized it could be PTSD or something else but I think um most of the people especially in this part of the world they associate trauma with something big like a terrible accident or they lose someone but um you talk about trauma in many different ways it doesn't have to be the trauma with the capital T it could be small everyday things like bullying which happened when I was in school um I'm talking about like 20 years ago and probably if you ask me now it doesn't affect me so much but did it do at that point

yeah a lot

now I I wonder if you do that visual thing again and think about the bullying see if it does bother you more on one side than the other so you're looking at your

I'm looking out of my right eye fi

yeah so it's it's actually not your right eye but your right lateral visual field

okay right A lot of people look at the whole eye and that goes to both hemispheres and you don't get a response

oh okay so you're looking exactly at the half right

okay yeah exactly half yeah okay so and and think about the bully did you have any reaction

a bit but not so much so how would you score it from

um again I would I would not score at more than three

okay and yeah and think about the bullying

don't strange it's strange this time I'm not I'm not having a big reaction on my left side it's um if that was three this would be like one

uhuh okay but I'm but also I'm so excited to talk to you I don't know if the excitement is changing

okay well usually I would expect it to be much higher on on on one side and and it can be either side that that has the negative thing and and and it's I call it what my first book is called of two minds and and what I mean by that is that if someone is um uh uh having a conversation with me uh looking out uh one side say they're troubled sign uh I'll look uh critical like maybe their mother was and that might be a trauma as as you point out that that I I think that U uh severe uh uh you know having an alcoholic father who beats mother and and throws the kid down the stairs repeat

I had that

okay okay we're going to do many experiments later

yeah well that's serious and uh uh but uh but you may not have that in mind in other words that that you may be thinking you know what happened a long time ago and it's not important but that's pretty severe a lot of times it's it's not even that severe it's more uh maybe a distant father who's not very uh involved and and uh is sort of rejecting or a mother I have a lot of men whose mother said oh you're a loser when they came criticizing them

yeah criticizing them or with friends or like your teacher or someone who didn't see you in the right light and that kind of stays with a lot of people I meet so many people who say every time you remind them of an emotion that kind of happened in their childhood and they're like oh my God I cannot like you know they they start shaking sometimes so those memories can be really strong

yes or they get angry what happens but what happens with that early trauma is uh that you go to school and it's harder to concentrate and then the teacher gets angry with you and so the the trauma then snowballs and then and maybe uh uh peers uh are getting critical because you're not doing well in the athletic field or or or in the classroom and so you wind up making friends with other people who are having trouble and then uh when when a person gets to be an adolescent they they start skipping school or drinking or uh uh and then uh might fail out of college and and each of these things is a great trauma and and if they become uh addicted uh then that's a great trauma they feel that they're an addict and and I like to say I don't have any addicts in my practice I have trauma victims and and that the addiction is an attempt by the immature side to deal with the trauma and and the immature side almost always picks uh solutions that uh uh bring on more trauma and and and and more distress and uh uh that when I see people in my practice they're often uh using drugs and and and they're it might be homeless or uh uh and feel really uh that their lives are failed and they have no idea that they have a healthy part to them and uh uh and uh we can elicit that uh with the envelope we can uh and I also have uh another way of stimulating the hemisphere and right now we're doing a a$2 and5 million uh NIH brand

is this the LED lights

yeah yeah it's an LED that we developed at MGH and we put it over the forehead um on one side say my uh left brain is my positive hemosphere and uh and it's it's just a 4minute treatment and the FDA has determined that has no significant risk and we haven't seen any uh side effects from it and uh

can you talk to us about how it works like so basically it's a light that goes on the forehead and is the the light pulsating at a certain frequency or it's like uh moving the blood flow into a certain part of the brain maybe The Logical Center or the emotional Center or an area that needs some help

um uh the light goes and the reason we picked it is near Red Light it goes through the skull

oh no way yeah

and and uh and it's called photobiomodulation and and it does a lot of good things to the brain uh but I don't think that's what I'm doing in other words it stimulates energy production decreases inflammation increases blood flow it it does a lot of um uh uh good things to the brain and it doesn't do anything that is known to be harmful to the brain

uh it's interesting because I don't know if you know this but I have um at one of my companies bioh Haagen we are we have photo modulation products and we developed yeah we developed a cap with red and near infrared light but these are the the LED lights are placed at certain parts different areas of the brain it's designed to stimulate the brain and um do some sort of a brain wave entrainment where we can teach the brain slowly on go how to go into like you know 10 HZ frequency or like a 40 HZ gamma brain w frequency but I did not know these LED lights were like uh near infrared the ones we use is for red and near infrared um it was developed for like athletes and people who are like Executives but most of the people now use it for hair loss because it has a it's got an effect on increasing the blood flow on the hair follicles and then it stimulates hair growth this is fascinating I did not know this

yes uh now but you're you're simulating both sides and and and uh so what I do is simulate one side and um and and in this grant we're treating fentanyl addiction and it's our third clinical trial and uh and we we uh in our first two trials got uh uh great results and so the FDA has given us a breakthrough designation and and uh and that's why we have this big Grant from it's from NIH the National Institute for drug abuse

congratulations

and um uh and uh half the people are getting a sham treatment uh and I don't know who's getting active in sham but I do know that uh if I rank the people according to uh how much they've decreased or fentanyl the top half uh have an 80% decrease in Fentanyl and a lot of them have stopped their fentanyl the bottom half have a 16% decrease and and some of them have have gotten worse uh and so they may be getting the I I'm hoping that the bottom half are getting sham and the top half are getting active treatment uh uh and I think that that's probably true because it's hard to treat a fentanyl with a poo

yeah I would I would ask you like what is what do you think is the mechanism of action there is it that

okay so what I think again I mentioned that there are known to be a lot of good things that happen with the brain but not in four minutes okay so someone can get a four minute treatment and uh and you'll notice the when we did the ey uh maneuver uh that takes place in seconds so so your response was um uh with within a few seconds and um uh with the light uh we give a 4minute treatment usually the person feels the difference in about 2 and a half minutes so and it's a special light that we developed it's very intense it's um uh 240 mowatt per cm squared and so so your lights are probably uh 10 m or something that and uh um and it's in a it's in one location and so it's concentrated so yeah so we're trying to simulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex so we put it over that and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a hub uh for the brain it's an association area and uh I'm trying to stimulate a mind so uh so I think that what what I'm doing is having actually a Quantum effect now I don't know that but I think that um uh uh that I think I'm stimulating uh brain information that becomes conscious and and that creates a conscious mind that has a different body of information it's a more positive body of information and I'm able to make it conscious if I put the light on the other side just like with the visual thing uh the the person will have a more negative uh Outlook and and uh uh uh they won't go into a catastrophe if you put it on the negative side but they'll have their symptoms that they came in with

does everyone have a different negative and a positive side or is it standard for everyone

it's pretty standard in terms of what I've seen over decades that that um uh that rather than uh it it being more logical or more artistic uh it's more uh uh symptomatic and neurotic uh versus healthy and sensible and and um uh I had an experience where it was the first time I was about 5 years after I wrote my first book and I was on a vacation in Italy and my wife was driving and we had a 5-Hour drive to an apartment that we rented and uh and I was feeling uncomfortable my wife is a good driver and she was driving and and uh and I felt like we were going to have an accident and I and I noticed after about an hour that the road was really safe it was like any road uh uh uh you know in in in the US that I drive one and um and then after a while uh I decided to put my hands up and block my vision and I was looking out my uh right lateral visual field which would stimulate my left brain and all of that anxiety went away just immediately and I looked out the other side and I got a Vavoom of anxiety and then we got to the the apartment and it had a balcony uh looking at over a road so I'm up on a balcony uh and and if I look out my uh right um uh my left uh um um um Lal Vision if I looked at my my left lateral visual field simulating my right brain uh I got very anxious and so they that I'm looking at cars on the on a road it was a it wasn't a highway it was a a back road but it was uh and I felt like the cars were sort of going to jump up and hit me and and I said well that's crazy you know and and I looked out the other side and felt perfectly safe and it was a normal Road and and uh and I had to wrestle with myself for about a day I said do I want to ruin the vacation I want to be crazy orane and and uh uh and I was able to Prevail but it with all my experience and you know writing a book and and and and it turned out I realized a few years later not at that time that it had to do with some trauma that I had experienced that being in Italy brought up and and um um and so that was the first time that I had experienced uh the the lateral visual effect and and I use it now if if I'm under stress I can get an envelope and look out and I use the uh light uh on most days I try and use it every day sometimes I I'll miss a day and I think it's good for cognitive enhancement and uh

that's so interesting could it were you um were you at any point when this this thing was happening this episodes of feeling scared or nervous or anxiety yeah um was your sleep the same as it is all the time CU here here's something that I'm thinking I have experienced something similar especially but I've made some long travels but one of the things that I also think is that sometimes I cannot sleep on the airplane then there is jet lag and you know then we know that the emotional side of the brain like flares up or has more activity when you are a bit sleep deprived and your brain is confused on what's going on and could for the everyday person could that also trigger something some sort of a negative experience

yeah that's absolutely true uh there was a movie with Steve Martin and Lilly Tomlin I do you know who they are

no but I will look them up

uh uh well Steve Martin is a a comedian and he he's in the US uh he he's sort of retired now but but he he was um at the height of his um uh popularity and was very famous and and uh and Lily Tomlin was also a comedian uh and uh so the story is that Lily Tomlin is meditating with her Guru and there's a terrible accident that the humming bow slips out of the guru's hands and tumbles down a a a huge flight of stairs in Manhattan and as a result l tomlin's mind gets embedded in Steve Martin's brain and and uh so you have uh Steve Martin in as the embodiment and Billy Tomlin wants to go downtown and Steve Martin wants to go uptown so he's going like this back and forth and she's screaming at him you know she wants to go here and he's trying to resist now if someone came by and and encouraged Lily Tomlin uh and then uh she would have gotten stronger and so if if something encourages the negative side say that you know someone is inducing somebody to use fentanyl that that'll arouse the negative side and it actually becomes stronger and uh so if Lily Tomlin was yelling loud enough she might have gotten her way and G downtown uh that the two sides can compete and they often when a patient comes in the two sides are often fighting and trying to kill each other or or they they don't acknowledge each other they and and what I do in dual brain Psychotherapy is to get them to cooperate and and to treat the trauma uh in the troubl side and use the healthy side as a co-therapist to help treat the trauma so uh you I think that you're right that um uh that uh external events can influence either side in other words If U uh uh let's say somebody wakes up and they're anxious and depressed and they get a phone call from work and there's a problem that they have to solve all of a sudden the depression anxiety go away and their business they're all business and and they attend to the problem

the brain shifts the focus

yeah yeah it it'll strengthen the mature side it'll Rouse the mature side so that these two minds are influenced by outside events and influenced by each other and uh that I'll teach the patient how to talk with the uh the troubl side and and he can influence it and and um and the troubled side often batters and and abuses the the healthy side now just because you mentioned the guru and meditation I wanted to bring up another thing like in the Eastern I'm originally from India and in the Eastern philosophy especially when it comes to yoga and yogis culture they have um they have a similar idea they talk about two sorts of like energy channels in the body which Al goes up to the brain which is the feminine side is Ida which is more creative more lunar energy you'll hear all these things in like the these are the terminologies and the male style is more masculine more logical and the goal is that these two are always fluctuating no one has like a complete balance like if you're a guru you probably have like a complete balance uh where there's a center point but in almost all of us there are these opposite Yin and yangs that are working all the time and and uh one could in certain situations get more agitated can be more anxiety prone and this is what we see today like you mentioned you know external events like even having substances like uh having two cups of coffee instead of one or you know just um looking at your screen for long amounts of time with the blue light and how it messes the Circadian rhythm and then there's a downstream effect on different things but you said something even interesting the two sides of the brain I I can't remember from who but years ago I read that yes of course you have these different sides of the brain and it also helps if you name them if you name um you know like my name is CJ and I would say cj1 or cj2 just for Simplicity and this is when you know that cj1 as in this part of your brain is becoming more dominant right now and while you while you don't get involved in the emotion this allows you to take a step back and observe the different parts of their brain and how they're communicating with each other so one part is being nasty or trying to kind of like sabotage the other one you could just say hey cj1 I see what you're doing like you know I want you know you some I don't know if it makes sense but it kind of like helps you even better than being a victim of the situation and saying like I'm I'm so stress thrown and my day isn't getting good if you take a step back and you say okay this part of my brain seems a bit overactive right now can I you know with meditation or just by talking or you know covering one eye can I influence one of these what's your thought on that

uh yes I I agree with you and and uh and I have Fred and Freddy uh

okay good

and and most of my patients you know I have two names you know usually you know their their regular name and and I put an ie you know uh uh to for a dimin uh term for the the child more I don't like the term in a child because I think it's overused and and and and kind of um uh devalued uh uh but but it is but what I'm talking about is an inner child and um U and and I think to give them two different names I think is is a is a reality they're two different people and and uh and I think it makes it easier to talk to them and so I'll have a conversation with Freddy and and uh um and it might be 3:00 in the morning you know if I wake up and I I get downstairs and and get a snack and I sit down and talk to Freddy and and uh uh and during the day um uh uh you know Fred needs to be in charge the light treatment stimulate the mature side and um and and the envelope can help in that regard

yeah the envelope is really good it's it gives Everyday People access because if someone is listening to this or someone is um looking at at us on video that is such a lwh hanging fruit that everyone can do no matter where they are and they don't have to have access to sophisticated technology of course the technology is so much more faster and has much more results but let's say someone's just having a bad day and you know if they have the power to just choose something like you know I had that book right here where I had my notes and if they could do it right in the moment it's a good thing for them because like like you said the snowballing effect we don't realize it but for the average person uh you know their boss is stress stressing them out then they have a stress out day they miss the gym they eat junk then they go have a fight with their partner then they have a fight with their kids kids are angry kids develop trauma so this is like it starts off with the smallest thing and if we give people the opportunity or the knowledge and I'm so grateful that you're putting all of this great work out there that yeah you can use Advanced things but like start off with the simple thing it's and also I have my book that I'm I put up here to my book U uh this this just came out this is my shout out everyone please check out uh it's called the goodbye anxiety uh depression addiction PTSD the life-changing science of dual brain psychology and it's an easy read uh uh so a lot of people might be intimidated uh uh by um um a book you know that has to do with science and but the science is is presented in a very easy to understand way and uh and there there's a chapter on self-help and and uh

oh that's good

and and their narrative fictional descriptions of actual therapy sessions um and and U uh so people tell me that it's an easy read that's good we will put the link in the show notes so everyone who can buy it they can buy it from us or anywhere internationally

now I want to ask you a question you've been I mean you've been with Harvard for such a long time and we know like really interesting things come out of there are they working on something secretive or like not secretive let's say like do you know about like projects studies devices that have been developed right now that could change the way our mental health is in the future I know that they're doing a lot of things in longevity and uh you know the future of biology psychology um and Neuroscience and all of these things combined so do you know of anything that is exciting for you

uh don't okay I think I think that um uh when I started at mlan it was a psychoanalytic Bastion you you can't find a psychoanalyst at mlan anymore or any any respectable hospital it's all drugs and insurance and people come in uh they they hardly get talked to and they just get put on medications and then discharged quickly and uh and I I I find that the state of psychiat today is very toxic and I think that Neuroscience uh has not resulted in in much knowledge uh or uh and or Therapeutics uh you know that there there is ketamine and there are Psych uh uh and and there uh the these might pan out to be um uh important developments but they seem to have uh problems and and uh um um I I I don't know that they're going to revolutionize the treatment of Psychiatry so

but a lot of people are using it now right like MDMA I know John Hopkins is doing a lot of research with uh MDA assisted Psychotherapy and then of course ketamine um I've even heard some stories about like DMT uh administers straight and looking at like how the regions of the brain are changing or how people's subjective experiences are changing under the same um modality

yes and and I don't know um uh of research at mlan I mean it might be going on but I don't know about it with using these substances MH and um uh so uh uh to answer your question I I not that I'm aware of okay in terms of some secret breakthrough

okay cool um let's talk about something else you know Elon Musk has been talking about like putting a chip into people's brain he calls it the neuralink what do you think about that do you think uh there is any efficacy of this or do you think in the future sure like for example instead of using the LED lights or using the envelope we could just plant a chip in our brain and then have like our iPhone as a remote controller and say okay stimulate Freddy now and stimulate Fred now do you think the future could look like this

um you know I don't I really don't know how the chip would operate you know so the chip would would I assume have some intelligence to it and and uh uh and uh there there is a modality called transcranial direct electral simulation I've done that and and U and if you uh the one side stimulates and the other side inhibits if you put it on front and and uh and that's been used to treat depression and and usually they'll stimulate the left side and and try and inhibit the right side and so you can sort of use electricity to stimulate uh you probably could use electrical Fields uh now uh we did some interesting studies with rtms so rtms uses a a magnetic field that causes a current in the brain MH and and for some reason that's unknown they all they only want to stimulate the left side the idea that uh left is good and right is bad uh is is kind of grounded in in in Psychology and Neuroscience um so I we did two studies uh to uh that what we find is about that there probably is more people who have a positive left brain but particularly in people with severe PTSD they're lot lot of times their left brain is their negative side and so um uh I would say generally but it's about 6040 the split and so you have to test people individually with to see which side is their positive side and their negative side so we did this with a group uh who were getting TMS which is a trans Grom magnetic stimulation it's a treatment for depression and uh and what we found was that if somebody had a negative left hemisphere uh they didn't do well with TMS if their left brain were were their positive side they did well and and we repeated this uh and and and got the same results with a uh one study was at Harvard uh with a uh at Bethal Hospital a different facility and I didn't run the study I just lent them uh uh the glasses to test the Baseline uh hemispheric balance and and the other study was done in Canada but we got the the same results and also there were gender differences that were matched and and uh uh uh so what what we found was that if you stimulate with the magnet uh a negative left brain uh you're not going to get a good result and the results with TMS are are mediocre uh and um uh that we we had much higher result in people with the Positive left brain who were getting their left brain stimulated and I tried to convince people uh to uh stimulate the right side in in those people who have uh their right side as their positive brain and no one would do it and that's how I got interested in the in the photobiomodulation I wanted something to stimulate the hemisphere more powerfully I I didn't have to Lug up three flights of stairs with a heavy machine and uh uh and it turned out that it it worked beyond our wildest expectations

that's amazing if you ever come to Dubai just bring it with you and we can test it with a lot of people over here I'm sure we have a lot of guinea pigs who will say I want to test it and see how it works we have a huge community of biohackers and you know held people here this is so fascinating you know I have a headset um which is an American company is called um blank out on the name I need some brain stimulation but um the idea is that they have a visor which it which has LED lights and this LED lights are flickering in a certain way um which can get you into the Alpha Brain wve State they have a headphone which has lights which are going into the ear canal Lo light um at 450 nanom and red light at 660 nanom and they're using Chinese Meridian and acupuncture points to get a signal into the brain the headsets itself has different kind of isochronic tones um binaural beads and a lot of these other kind of sound Technologies but the most interesting thing that I found was that they found a way to let's say let's to keep it simple they found a way to induce three sets of sounds at the same time so one is coming from the left ear one is coming from the right ear and then there is a subconscious programming message going on which could be self-help or you know talking about your traumas and how you can release them but the immediate effect of all these stimulation going in your brain is that if you lie down with lights closed it'll take you to that Delta brain wave state where you're just you feel like you're sleeping but you're not really sleeping and then the program is going on for like 25 minutes by the end of the program you wake up if you if you really went to sleep you don't remember what's going on but your subconscious mind registers it and the more often you do it then you have a change in your behavior your perspective your way of thinking just because the sounds are going through different um you know different ear passages and they say that they are stimulating different parts of the brain

uh yes I think sound does cross over and and it's not as powerful uh neurologic connection as the eyes but but the ears are connected to the opposite brain uh and um um and so I I think that's really interesting I'm not aware of that technology and and it might be that if they did a baseline uh test with with the uh envelope uh that they might reverse uh uh the earphones and and uh and some individuals and and and improve their results I don't know that just a suggestion

I would I would be excited to see like your LED lights with uh transcranial direct simulation with the headphones with like you know a biohacker tech which goes through maybe in the next two to three years or the next five years which goes through all of the different entry points and then you know has different mechanisms of action and like gets us into an altered state or like a state which is preferable um yeah so I'm excited about that hopefully that happens sometime soon

I have a patent pending uh on a device that uses music and and I I play caling music uh opposite the uh troubled side and uh so it's not as sophisticated as what you're describing uh but uh but I I have you know been you know playing around a little bit with sound but um uh um um but you know what what you're describing is interesting and and I'll email you the link of the device they're really big yeah I'll do that

okay um Dr shiffer this has been super exciting thank you so much for your time we have covered so many things and I think people have like a better idea on um what dual brain psychology is if you don't please read the book I'm also going to link to his website and some of the other things so you can take a deeper read but before I let let you go is there anything that you want to share any you know tips practical stuff what you want people to see what you want people to do anything the floor is yours

uh I think that the real breakthrough occurs when you teach uh in other words not tell the the the trouble side but get the trouble side to think and and say uh do do you think that you really were a bad child uh and and and get to sort of have a Socratic discussion with it and when the when the uh little boy or little girl is able to go aha I'm really not bad uh I really don't need to fear the bullies uh that's when uh the person really gets better

okay interesting thank you so much thank you so much for all the good work that you're doing thank you for giving us your time thank you for getting on the podcast so early before I let you go my last question to you is if you could reverse time let's say we made a technology developed and we put you into a time capsule you could go back to younger self but only for like 30 seconds and you could give back your younger self one piece of advice what would that be

uh well I I I I don't know I think things have played out it's just taken too long you know that that so that uh uh you know I'm uh in my 80s now you know and and uh and I have so much more work to do and uh uh so you know I wish all this happened faster but it takes time to make discoveries and and and uh especially if you're discovering something that is sounds strange and it's hard to get other people uh to um join in the the other thing that I think happens is there's a line from Shakespeare that says uh there is a tide in the Affairs of men which Shen at the flood leads on the fortune and and uh uh and I think if I were researching drugs in in in the 1980s it would have been easy to promote myself uh and and promote what I was doing uh but this this you know is not supported by any outside flow I'm the only person working on the hemispheres and and and you know I have colleagues at mlan who work with me uh uh uh and the NIH has been good to me um uh but um uh and also the US Army is uh applying for a very large Grant to treat to depression and combat PTSD with my light and and uh so but but there hasn't been really a stream of of I'm I'm always swimming Upstream

okay but I don't know how to answer the question except that I I think um uh things have worked out well for me and it's just a life you know takes time and has its obstacles

I guess I then the lesson that we can share with everyone is of patience and persistence and believing in what you do because yes you're right it takes time um whenever we hear stories of others we always hear like how fast things have happened but we don't see those countless million stories which were either unsuccessful they never got to the place or it took too much time because we always romanticizing the idea of things becoming fast and instant gratification a good way to think about is like if you want a child like you know you can you can make someone pregnant but it still takes nine it still take nine months you cannot sleep with nine people and expect you know the baby in a month nature and some some things have its own time and the faster you understand it and are peace with it at least you won't stimulate the other side of your brain how about that how about we close with that lesson

good okay yeah it's been a pleasure

thank you thank you this has been pleasure for me as well and this is CJ everyone your host your friend signing out of the ship for CJ podcast everyone have an amazing day amazing week Amazing Life find a book find an envelope try to do this experiment read his book and remember good things in life will take time be patient this is me signing out of the shipit CJ podcast take care everyone"
